## Session 5
* Leaving @ noon, bringing cart with the loot. Finliph pulling the cart
  * 2h and soaked to get back to town
  * Sold 1 crossbow to sheriff for 30gp
  * Someone had seen a large bird a week ago, "vultures", and another bird. Black, size of a man, flying east.
  * 100gp for weps, 50gp for food/wine/wagon
    * Roughly ~20gp loose, 30 off sheriff, 150 off sales = 200
* Drink the day away, go at 10pm to check on the shrine
* First stakeout: Nothing happens, detect some magic in the shrine later, probably the holy water Kai asked for
* Tavern: Rumor - Large vultures with riders, 3-4. Also ~4 flying birdmen
  * One vulture even had a horse! Possibly
* Tavern: Rumor - Shrine - Activity on weekends, sometimes midweek, more often weekend.
  * Nothing ever damaged, just some noise, somebody going around back there
* Finliph got lessons on how to not be a dick
* Kai shared info on the farmers who were kidnapped, feather, etc

* Plan is to go north to Beliard on foot - ~3d, 75-80mi
  * Then east cutting through High Forest to Star Mounts
    * 80mi to forest, 80 mi to mounts
* Kai suggests we tell sheriff we're going, Xanavor tells the Tarnlars as well
  * Sheriff - Mentions goblins to the south, does not want Xanavor leaving without handling them
  * Tailors - 100gp for the bandits
    * Gladhams in the area 10-15y, distrusted the half-orc husband for a while. Good folks though. Daughters birthday was about a week ago. Naya is her name
    * Not much known of the father's background, mother is from a well-established family near Yartar
* Finliph info on the forest
  * Some Elves and such in there
  * Infested with orcs/trolls who play out old feuds
  * Aaracocra are xenophobic, gifted at vocal mimicry (sounds, voices, etc)
    * Not necessarily evil or good, just isolationist

* Action plan: Pursue the goblins, talk to drunk guy to get count/location
  * Bottle of wine by way of apology
  * Xanavor wants to talk to tailor again to tell them he *won't* be leaving town yet
    * Small group, near the old tomb to the south, half a kilometer
      * Either scouts or a skittish group, they didn't attack, backed off
    * Leaves off switching for Efram
  * Finliph & Kai talk to sheriff, find out the kid is who to talk to, not the drunk. Go by the shrine's junk pile to find the kids. Find 'em
    * Kids respond well to non sequitur
    * Saw 2,
      * Green, same size as children
      * Green, taller than Finliph/Kai
      * One had an axe, or a sword. Kids, amirite?
    * Kids were invited to Naiya's party, then parents didn't let them go since they had "left town" or something. Don't play with her often but like her.
    * Kai's daycare tactics are popular. Harmless tremor is a crowd pleaser
