## Session 8
* Interrogation
  * Seems to not know where the family went
    * Knows they've been gone more than a week, saw bird creatures
    * Creatures: Black specks, silver specks, lots of feet (they were carrying horses)
      * Might live east?
  * He's from south
    * A camp a few miles south
      * Presumably 8-16, not including the ones we killed already
      * Only goblins
        * Heard of one who became friends with a half-ogre. He was exiled from camp
      * Poop hill, you'll smell it
  * "just got here"
  * Gave no reason for being here other than it being empty
* We seem to have happened across them quickly, things are only somewhat amiss.
  * Belongings: Two jewelry boxes, relatively small.
    * Daughter: 1gp or so worth of jewelry
    * Wife: 150gp worth of necklaces/earrings/rings. Some decent gemstones

* Short rest

* Set out, found the poop hill in late afternoon, hid a little, decided to wait around and see what they do
  * About 12 goblins, hard to be sure but it seems about right
  * A few gather together around 6-7pm, 2 leave and head in our direction
    * Followed them for a bit, then got detected, then fought and killed them. 10 left.
  * Return to where we were, hide again, watch again. Hope they send more in a couple hours.
  * Three leave, we wait 10m, set up a plan with the orb and hiding in trees to lure a couple more out and insta-gib. Semi works, takes a while but we get all but 1.
    * Last one ran off -- Chase scene!!
  * Nothing particularly valuable found in camp
    * 45g worth of trinkets
