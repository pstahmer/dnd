## Session 37
* Kill Thurr, 2 knights/vultures, 2 aaracokra
* Thurr cracks some kind of wind orb, huge storm on the roof. We eventually make it to safety (Kai was flung off the roof)
  * We start out hiding on the top level, but it starts to crack so we run further down
    * Before leaving, find another 59gp
* Short rest outside, then go to a bit away from the entrance and long rest there. It's a sheltered space with limited visibility from above.
  * Attacked by Manticore, it goes for a horse first though, weirdly
  * Seems to have been larger in the past. Seemed quite hungry and malnourished
  * Kai spots 2 Aarakocra flying towards the former spire
