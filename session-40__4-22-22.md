## Session 40
* Xano invisible's kai/fin. He and Chad then enter the room, the other two following to search for Ahtayir's horn
  * 5 monks inside, hoving 6in off the ground meditating. They are around a hole in the floor with a softball-sized orb
  * Wild-looking man further in. With a rage-y guy by him
  * Upstairs: Windharrow and a bunch of others lounged around on cushions, smoking opium
  * Winged elf draping herself across a throne in the middle. Long-spear in her hand
  * Conversation full of deception, some otherwordly thing lifts Chad by the neck 9 inches off the ground. He turns it
    * Xanavor. Fucking. Monologues.
  * She knew little of Ajwa, just that he is a thorn in Yan See Bin's side. Windharrow was sent 2 years ago to find him, got close, failed. Has been on her bad side since. A few months ago something happened that made her god happy. And that wrested control of Ajwa away from himself
  * She actually gives us Windharrow!
  * We try to negotiate a trial by combat for the freedom of the Gladhams
    * Finliph fights an invisible stalker, it is freaking _tough_. Loses.
  * Chad partakes in the opium, calls it the best tobacco he's ever had, requests some for the road
  * Fetch the prisoners we earlier freed and leave
* Windharrow tries shenanigans, we knock him out, strip him of all his items/etc. He has nothing but his clothes left. Bound, gagged, etc.
* Stalker tries to grab and carry Windharrow away
  * Xano shoots it and gets it to drop him like 50ft to the ground
* Windharrow
  * How did he know how to find Ajwa - Hints, rumors, long and distorted family lineage. Hints at Xano's father not sharing any of this info. W claims that ring has been in Xano's family for a loooong time
  * Tries to cast something, Chad casts Silence to stop him.
* We discuss plans of destroying the floating orb in the hopes of taking down the whole temple.
  * Want to rescue the Gladham's if possible, but all agree we should not engage upstairs again

## Goals
* Soul searching, reflection, prep, shopping
* Xano to ring
* Kai to ring?
* Figure out how to deal with stalker
