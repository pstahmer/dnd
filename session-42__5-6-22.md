## Session 42
* Windharrow
  * Everthing you know about Xano family
    * Killed because they didn't give what he wanted.
  * What do you know about Ajwa's deal - He doesn't know who Ajwa is
  * How to get to prisoners
    * No safe way down
    * They transfer by throwing the prisoners down. He has never been, doesn't know if they survive
  * Where is Atayir's horn - Behind the dias
  * Gladhams - He wasn't there. Mirage was. The tower guy
  * He escapes.
* Invisible Stalker kills Windharrow
  * Kai Marks it, senses that it's moving away from us, _extremely_ quickly.
  * We surmise it was probably never meant to spy on us, but instead to wait for a chance to kill him.
* Cat starts leading us north, we follow since we think it's same direction as the farmer with the burned crops
  * Chad tells us that it means enemies of Bacaab are in the vicinity. Chad suspects the Cult of Eternal Flame
* Weatherbee tells us a little more, but seems to be withholding. Kai presses him and eventually it's revealed that "they" told him to bring us
  * Turns out "they" is the black earth cult
  * He goes invisible and runs off
  * Kai catches him in a trap while they're both invisible
  * He was doing as he was told
  * Says he needs to "secure its future" (regarding his farm)
    * Implies that Helenrae had helped him a lot over the years, and that he fears for the future of his farm and family without her
  * An old Uthgard Barrow is where he was leading us
    * Elk, Tiger, Bear symbols inside (Kai is an offshoot of elk tribe)
  * Mentions Mirage Vison as one of the remaining Black Earth Cult leaders
  * Casts barkskin and Shillelagh
    * Druid!
  * Original plan was simply to trap and starve us in there
    * An undead creature rose up to protect its tomb. Wants him and his son dead. He asks us to protect his son
  * Says Mirage Vison knows us. All of us. Would know if he killed us
    * Cast inflict wounds as he died, end up rebounding onto himself
      * This implies he was devoted enough to earth god to be a follower granted power
      * Xano remembers and shares that Gods if strong enough can supposedly see through the eyes of their followers, if they're devoted enough
  * Loot: Summon elemental scroll, magic cane
  * Burn his body (necromancy nearby). Bury the ashes and mark the gravesight
* Barrow - Door visibly disturbed. Seems to have the animals representing _every_ barbarian tribe. Kai has only known them to fight, not collaborate
  * Kai remembers that he Uthgar as a whole tend to shun the very concept of undeath. Necromancy at play here likely not their doing
  * Xano detect magic: Evocation up the wazoo
  * Open the door, waft of frigid air comes out
  * Kai runs in, takes a level of exhaustion from the extreme cold
  * Cavern somewhat carved out, somewhat natural. Large boulders on either side seem to be plinths. Symbols carved on them. Marked for the various tribes
    * Little flames on some of them. Consuming nothing but giving off blue light
  * Could be tomb of Uthgar, the progenitor of the Uthgar barbarian tribes?
