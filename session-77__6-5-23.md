## Session 77
* We kill the medusa and another 6 gargoyles. Also get another group of dwarves out

### Plans for next session
1. Wrap up the mine, clear any leftover gargoyles and free any remaining dwarves
2. Rescue Ludwazack from the lidless?
  1. We're tapped out on spells/resources. Need to consider how to do this without TPK
