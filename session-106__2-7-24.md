## Session 106
* Firatril - Finliph explains nothing, Kai casts Hunters Mark on him, he seems to notice but not be able to place what he felt
* We go to an elven wine bar, and Finliph spots that the proprieter behind the bar is Ihel. Finliph shares that he used to come here frequently, ~30y ago with his adventuring crew. And something about a HellGate?
  * They say that Finliph was the only one who didn't return and was presumed dead. The party said he had walked into a portal and vanished.
    * Firatril opened the portal that Finliph went through, he thought the rest would follow but they didn't. Dropped him near Neverwinter. 30 years ago
  * Hellgate was an old elven castle in the northeast corner of the High Forest. Ambushed by a wizard, losing the fight, ran away through the portal
  * Mayor Firatril hasn't been the same since Hellgate
  * The Hellgate Wizard - Statues representing each variety of elves, glistening in the moonlight. In the center was a Wizard casting a spell. Elven. The statues came to life and started fighting them.
  * Old group: Wizard, Druid, Ranger, Rogue, Finliph
  * HellGate was the site of a demonic incursion during the fall of the Elven empire. Was one of the final straws. After sealing up the portal the losses were so high that it fractured the empire. The statues are likely a fragment of the great works of the past
* 1 month ago the snow started
* Visiting Firatril
  * Refers to Hellgate as a painful memory he'd rather not speak of
  * Claims to have found enlightenment there. Called it a sacred place
  * Whole party seemed to come back with newfound purpose. Mayor, one went to Monastery, two went to their homes bringing their new sense of purpose with them. Firatril has brought a new sense of peace to the village. They used to want to be more political, more involved wtih the outside. Would want to re-create the golden years of the old empire. He has re-focused them on the modern meaning of being an elf.
  * Town does have guards and a small military. Keeps in touch with elves in the forest. Mutual defense but not really much contact outside the forest
  * Believes the it's the Monastery is what's messing with the weather
    * Mentions that the winds prevent flight. The snows make the trail treacherous
    * Rama Soren Rainfeather (Owlen) is still the grandmaster
    * Faer Cruki Hess (Aaracokra) is now the right hand
    * A device that is usually well protected seems to have been broken. Somewhat Gyroscopic device. A group of Aaracokra came through a week before (feathergale?)
    * Seems to get offended when it's mentioned that he's a powerful wizard
    * Mentions a pilgrimage to Virderoth
    * Met a powerful enemy wizard in Hellgate who animated the statues around them. And other monsters. Almost Chimearic. Was animating an army for himself. One of his group was killed. Shortly after a Goddess appeared. Virderoth. She rescued them from certain doom. Slew the wizard, fell the statues, all with a wave. Then communicated almost to the soul a way of peace. A way to use their powers not to rend, but to augment the life remaining.
      * Others went to Lurkwood, Neverwinter, Monastery to spread the message
      * Perspectives change when peace and cohabitation become the goal
    * Pilgrimages to Hellgate in honor of Virderoth. Some in town have done so
  * Insight: Something in the way he speaks feels... imprinted on him. An odd repetition
  * Philosophy is largely on looking forward instead of to the glories of the past. Almost the opposite of what Yoreel has described
  * His memory is fuzzy of the moment the portal opened, and when Finliph went through it
    * Never asked goddess to return him, that would be trying to change the past
    * Didn't look like an extraplanar portal
    * Tried to communicate, got no response. Sending failed to reach him? Clairovoyance and Scry failed.
  * He gave up his studies, doesn't need them anymore
  * Finliph reveals himself
    * Conversation heats up, everyone turns on him and his philosophy of defeat
    * Fanny casts Dominate Person, he slumps in his seat. It works, he explains what happens when he met the goddess
      * He saw a form come down from the skies, and with a wave of her hand the wizard vanished, the statues stopped moving, and she spoke. It was like music speaking to his heart. Spoke of the past, of the future. Promised to free them of strife, trials, tribulations, etc. Showed them "how to be". How to let the things they could not control slip by, and to try to influence the things they could.
