## Session 44
* Get the farmer's son to bring to barbarians
  * After some pressing, he relays Mirage Vison's greetings to us and runs off into the fields
  * Has a dagger and some spell components in his hands. Cuts his hand and casts Sacred Flame and some kind of Ethereal Sword (spiritual weapon)
  * Finliph just brutalizes him. Limbs fly everywhere.
  * Tell Barbarians he chose death
* Start teaching Chad Elvish phrases for combat
* Continue on to Rivergard
* Chad's cat stares off towards Scarlet Moon hall as Chad is overcome with a sense of Deja Vu
  * We head to ~~burning man~~ Scarlet Moon Hall
    * The large burning figure looks utterly unchanged
    * Less general smoke than before
  * We follow the cat
    * It goes up to the tower, gets rebuffed. After a brief conversation one of the guards recognizes Chad and permits us in
    * It then goes into the scaffolding. Weird metallic creature with a head of flame at the top. Some form of elemental.
      * "Oh I didn't see you come out"
    * Next level seems to feature a barracks
    * Someone calls him "sir", when asked he says that Chad lives upstairs
    * Go upstairs, see an apparent identical twin of Chad's?
      * "Oh, okay then. I was told you would be coming. I wasn't expecting you so soon"
      * They both light their pipes
      * Symbol of the Burning whatev's on the rug
      * Valecia hops up onto the desk and sits there
