## Session 84
* Refugee camp has sentries w/ cowbells, they look exhausted as we proceed into our night watch.
  * During third watch the cowbells ring. The shadows are coming
  * Everyone gathers in the Shrine, Cleric + Fanny work to try warding the windows, warn us against letting the spirits in. As long as the windows are closed and doors sealed, they can't get in
  * Xano sees Earl outside the window
    > Let me in! They're coming!
  * Finliph sees the General
    > Finliph Alberoth, return my sword! You have been found unworthy, return it now!
  * Kai sees Gladham
    * Tells him he found his daughter, needs kai to let them in
  * Kai sees 3 middle aged humans chanting and holding hands. He casts silence and their eyes go to him as they stop chanting.
  * Driftglobe daylight spell keeps the shades at bay, the chanters look angry
  * We exit, combat ensues. We defeat 3 ghosts that seem to have been summoning the shades
  * When asked how they can repay us, we request nothing but a vial of holy water, saying the town could use any traditional payment more than us. Fanny gives the priest 10 gold
* Kai runs off to find Grund, to no avail
* Fanny and Xano chat about the book and her uncle.
  * She claims to be about to tell everything.
  * When she was getting ready to leave baldur's gate due to some... mistakes she ran into a wizard, and stole the location of a powerful magic item he created of unknown capabilities. The cookbook is a cipher text to the location. Thus she needs it.
  * Xano eventually gives her the book
* Long rest, seeming.
