## Session 9 - 7-8-21
* Rest and follow the 3 remaining gobbies
  * Follow for a few hours, don't seem to be stopping or reaching their target. Sun is rising
  * Kai got tired, like a baby. We need to long rest to mitigate his exhaustion
    * LEVEL UP
  * Follow for another couple hours, they seem to have not rested
    * After a few hours, we smell smoke and hear chattering. Large palisade wall in the distance, standing ~10ft high. Is rather large, seems several times larger than the camp we came from
    * Plume of smoke, goblinoid head bobbing around top of wall
      * towers, poop pits, huts, smaller huts, longhouse
      * We observe one guard tower rotation
        * 8 guard positions, 60-80ft apart, 1 gob each
        * Large one in the south, with 2 gob
        * Gate in the south by large tower
      * Some fights, some eating, bonfire perpetually stoked in the middle
      * Some non-combatants/children in the longhouse
      * A couple hundred counted, maybe 1/3 combatants (so ~60-100?)
      * 1/2 - 1/3 the size of Redlarch, which has 600 people in it
* Leave and return to first camp, draw broken eye symbol to try throwing trail away from Redlarch
  * min 1d head start before gobs find out about the camp
  * Draw eye symbol in bodies, game of thrones style
  * Gruesome work, did it using literally every body. Towards the end Xanavor felt a great pain in his temple and got forcibly pulled into the ring
  * Xanavor re-appears, the pocket the ring was in of Kai's tears itself out of the pocket
    * They were 100ft out from the camp. Xanavor lands flat on his back and scrambles to his feet sprinting to the camp and frantically throws apart the diamond in the middle of the symbol. Only the outline remains
    * Xanavor requests (successfully) that kai cast protection from evil on him and we depart
      * Felt nothing after departure, or after wear off
* Speaking about it on the way back
  * Xanavor shares what he knows
    * It is of death, of demonic, of necromancy. It has a cult, it has power via bodies or death or something
  * Kai recalls something of elemental cults in the past
    * His tribe was wiped out by orcs, no idea if they are related. He was unconscious when they attacked.
    * From Dessarin hills. Attacks were not unheard off, but this one was successful
  * Xanavor shares his backstory
    * House burned down, rubble, stranger, music. Found the burned bodies, safe, ring, Djinn/Genie, etc.
  * Finliph is from the north, where there are evidently a great many orcs. Specifically there were many in the mountain regions (Spine of the World). He is from Lurkwood
    * Mentions an "uneasy peace" between the elves and orcs in the region
* Return to redlarch, took 2 days to return
* Xanavor creates a passable map between Red Larch, Westwood, Goblin camp, Goblin town, Khelldell Path
* Kai makes a map of the camp. Lower quality, but easier to do
* Xanavor and Kai very quiet on the trip back
