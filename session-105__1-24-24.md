## Session 105
* Meet Yoreel, it doesn't go well. He and Finliph very nearly come to blows, and become even more suspicious of each other
  * Yoreel reveals Finliph's noble heritage before they part ways
* Following the boat: Still not returned, mostly stops in for supplies. Never fully disembarks. Only ever passes through. Often gone a week or so at a time
* Leave towards Summit hall, Yoreel stops them and warns that there are hundreds of orcs camped around it
* Party decides to try going to the star mounts to raise help to free Summit Hall from its siege. They also decide that their business is its own and Yoreel's is his own
* Before boarding the Roc Yoreel takes a lock of hair from his horse
* Successfully navigate to the town on the Star Mounts (Khle'cayre)
  * On the way we experienced stronger than usual winds. In fact to Finliph's memories the winds here are generally quite calm. Also he sees no lights on the monastary in the mountain. Instead we land in the town at the foot of the mountain
  * As we land Finliph notices the ground is coated in snow. In September.
* As we walk into town Finliph sees a face he hasn't seen in 20-30 years. Firatril
  * Wizard who accompanied him to hellgate? Apparently should be _super_ dead
