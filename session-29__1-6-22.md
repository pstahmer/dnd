## Session 29
* Get horses, then follow bandits almost straight east
* Come across battle site, see the fancy cart still there. Ornate red wood coffin inside with its lid ripped off. Body is exposed and tilted, as though rifled through
  * Stash the body in a nearby cave / bear nest
* Rock that battle
* Notice the horses are branded from the Selwyn ranch (east and south of here), likely almost all the horses they had
  * Peon knows nothing, but was hired in Beliard
  * A bounty is on us, few have responded thus far
    * 100gp/ea
  * Confirmed Grimjaw sending us to him was part of the plan
  * Loot wasn't part of the job
  * Hired a few days ago. Effectively same day we went on the boat, towards the night. After both we did the mission and Grimjaw spoke to the birds
    * Order was to capture us, not kill us
      * He rarely takes prisoners. If he wanted us alive it's because somebody else asked for us
  * Bought the horses off the bugbears that were headed to the enclave - Bugbears were looking for cash to buy the weapons shipment from Grimjaw
  * Found out about the bounty via raven

## Goals
* Return body & ask them to hold horses for a day
* Intercept weapons shipment to bugbears, dump it in river
* Return horses
* Return codebook to Lords Alliance + debrief
  * Debrief - Locations of all 4 now identified. Goings on at Rivergard - Arming orcs, bugbears, etc. Seeming bandit lord stuff. Fire faction goal unknown. Earth found something they liked
  * Ask about goblin developments?
  * Ask about elders? Either here or sheriff
