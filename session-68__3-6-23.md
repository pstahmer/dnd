## Session 68
* Down the hole
  * Spiders!
  * Lots of spidey foot mummified down here, including some we sent tumbling down. ~10 bodies.
* East hallway, towards Nondar
  * Wooden palisade cordons it off. Seemingly a matching one on the other side. Littered with old bodies. Armor seems to partially match wood elves, partially match bahumut followers
    * Disturbed ground, but no tracks - Wraith?
  * Ghost with fine bow and sword, very elegant posture, and lots of pompous spunk

## Next time

  * shopping
  * last 1000 year cycle. Dragons?
