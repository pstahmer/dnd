## Session 67
* Spiders around here appear and disappear at will
* Enter the cave, Wood Elves inside
  > We serve he who will get rid of filth like you!
  * Banner w/ symbol similar to the one from the keep. Emblem of a dragon but it is skeletal this time
* Big hole with spider webs, some bodies suspended above
  * Phase spiders!
  * Bodies chained to walls, seemingly to trap prisoners as spider food?
  * Undeath glyph under a body
  * Dragon - Bahumut sigil perverted to besmirch original meaning. Seems likely this was indeed Lord Dreslin Nondar. Similar to his own fall from life into undeath, these symbols are undergoing a transformation.
    * Finliph scratches out the sigil with his magic sword
      * Low moan, smell of death and decay wafts into the corridor from the eastern hallway. Something reacted to this


## Next time
* Elemental gift + fly down spider hole
* East hallway, Nondar
