## Session 19
* Return to town
  * War cleric wants to join a war
  * Sheriff says La'Roque pulled one over on the old folks. Probably was selling reverse mortgages. Stone cult has been going 50y
    * Cult activity dying down a bit
    * orc movement to the northeast
  * Tarnlarrs
    * Eye symbol is that of an ancient cult that worshipped a God of old (a greater one)
      * So old it's hard to find info on it. Roughly every 1000 years they come up. Seems to pop up every 1k to try drawing power, and if he can he'll re-materialize in the plane
    * LA is looking to get more public about the search for the emissaries, with me being the face of it
    * Goblins No update, attempting to muster a force if we can't handle it ourselves
    * Moving stones: 1000 years ago a calamity threw things out of whack. Orcs took over the region. Elves + Humans forced them back to spine of the world (and a few in the high forest).
      * This area 1000 years ago was predominantly dwarven. This was a temple to a minor dwarven god. Enchanted so that any sufficient vibration would cause all the stones to levitate and move. Thought to be communing with their god through this. Drum circle would trigger this too.
    * Nulasemar fell in battle, while defending Miramar from a rather large Orcish horde

* Go to feathergale to try negotiation/sneaking again
  * Found Stable, Barracks, etc
  * Negotiation fails horribly. Combat ensues.
  * Kill 2 knights, sergeant, 3 initiates
