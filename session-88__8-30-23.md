  * Peryoal is putting together construction + excavation crews. Will contact via sending stone when she has names to give Alejandro

    * Ask Garth to inquire about trading rocks/building materials
* Long rest - xp: 9225 - Dragon, fighting pit, portal
* Garth discussion:
  * Takes a bit to convince him we're us
  * Thanks us, and gives us a very large and ornate heavy belt. Claims it is a royal artifact Bhun wished for us to have. Belt of dwarvenkind
  * Suggest he seek out trade details w/ Alejandro
* Revisit the caves by the Grahams to see if any necromancy is happening again. No movement.
  * Symbol of the evil eye still present, Xano deliberately messes up all occurrences of it
  * Put the driftglobe back. Things darken slightly, then it gives off light without being activated by us. Soon after, the symbol from the tapestries (evil eye) appears in the center of the far wall
    * EVIL EYE
    > Who seeks my favor
    > My heralds have thus far failed. If you can succeed where they have not I have much power to give
    * Xano asks what he wants of his heralds
    > A temple. A place where I may be seen. Felt.
    * Who are you?
    > I've had many names over many eons. I am as you would put it, a god. I am one of the masters of creation. I created the very firmament upon which you walk. I have every name, and none. I exist everywhere, and yet nowhere.
    * Mentions his influence has been pushed aside here. That he predated Fanny's god, and possibly our universe itself? Certain the current pantheon
    * Says the necromancer found the key, and it drove him insane. And that "it" has not taken us yet
    * Xano rejects him and removes the orb
    > You have much to learn about how gods work. Ask your lady of luck
  * Darkglobe gets put next to driftglobe
    * It falls to the ground
  * Darkglobe on pedastal alone
    * Nothing happens
