## Session 25
* Wake up from rest, large birds circling overhead, then head towards keep. Land in courtyard
  * Don't hear combat
  * Go to do boat job, figure we'll find out before leaving or upon returning if there's an important development
  * Can't find out what's in the boxes
  * Aaracokra and big birb leave
  * Grimjaw summons us
  * Talks of gods, he reveres, but does not serve
    * "She is water itself" Olhydra
    * She respects work. Nothing is free
    * Birds "can't keep up their skirmishes", are having difficulty. Came with 1/3-1/4 the usual numbers today
    * Wants us to attack them, take them out. Or at least cut off the head -- Merosska OR go on boat trip, if they attack the original deal holds
  * We go to the boat, will go to tower afterwards for a different reward
    * Captain is water Genasi
      * Has the blessing of Olhydra - And tattoo on the inside of his chest - Symbol-Water
    * Clothes, weapons, food
  * Yan See Bin faction attacks, they bring money for "the book"
    * We kill them all, no survivors
    * Captain gives us a writ to give Grimjaw
  * Cargo is shitty weapons, surprisingly so. The kind that maybe goblins would make. That level of quality
  * Some crates are marked in orcish - These are the ones with the shitty weapons
  * One crate is nearly empty - Has the book
    * Lords Alliance code in the book - Likely taken from a dignitary. One of several

Ending late afternoon, 3-4pm

## Next session
* Leave one of the weapons crates slightly ajar so it looks like that's all we found. Pack the rest up as close to as it was as quickly as we can
* Return the LA dispatches to an agent
* Return to Grimjaw with our note
