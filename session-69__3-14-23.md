## Session 69
* Wraith touches a glowing skull, 2 familiar seeming ghosts appear.
  * Xano blasts the skull to pieces
* Kill the Wraith lord, he drops an amulet holding enchantment and divination magic
* The altar in the corner seems to have 8 symbols. They match the symbols from the seal in the castle
  * Meaning it matches the castle after the cult altered them
    * Unclear what Vannifer gains from this, but etchings look newer than a year
      * Seems to be complementary portals. The one in the keep took stuff in, this one spat the same stuff out. The orb seemed to be hovering in the keep above the portal, and seemed to be absorbing magic while the portal obsorbed physical things
      * Some magic did go into the portal though. Maybe that sustained the skull/wraith?
    * Stones appear to have been carved from the wall
  * Some of the stuff around here looks like it could have come from the castle
  * Headless skeleton appears to be of the lord, clothes match
  * Tl;dr: We need some identify spells
* Kai finds a small blue gem. Lots of coins and gems scattered and pushed into the corners and piles
* See channel for loot
* Looks like the coffin was actually moved, so Vannifer and her followers may have brought it here
* Outside the cave is a dead Phase Spider and a small skeletal lizard. The two wood elf guides step out when we re-appear, they are covered in blood. Their wounds have been healed though
* Uneventful return to Nightstone
* Short rest, lunch, start back to waterdeep
