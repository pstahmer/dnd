## Session 5
* We almost left the room

## Session 6
* Where the hell have I let Quinz lead me? First there were brains with legs coming out of corpses, now there's one with a beak on the ceiling!
* Also potentially fake vampires?

## Session 7
* The angry dwarf interrogated the prisoner, coated his hands and mace in the blood of the prisoner's companion first. It was effective, but deeply unnerving.
* Something clawed struck the Minotaur, then shrank down a halfling and tried to run away.
  * After we killed it the elf cut it open and... harvested the heart.
* Do these guys always desecrate so many corpses?
