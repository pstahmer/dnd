## Session 4
* Daheel - Firbolg female - Guide
* Brains out of bugbears
* A brain attacks Quinz, he goes down. We can't seem to revive him. After ~9h he gets back up though
* Apparently our objective is to make it to skullport
* Find a faintly glowing longsword on a corpse, stabbed into a wooden armor stand
  * Several of the runes are dedicated to the Light spell (the reason the sword glows)
  * Enchantment and Conjuration runes as well
  * We hear voices throughout the whole investigation, seemingly from the sword
  * The sword returns to the hand that holds it. Seems to be able to return to wielder
