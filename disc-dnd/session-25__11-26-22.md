## Session 1
* I found Quinze! Turns out all it took to find him was meeting a rude dwarf and greedy tortle.
* Okay, Quinze has changed a bit. Apparently he's a paladin now? But not in service to any god. I think he took an oath to rule following or some nonsense like that. Supposedly it worked though and he can make a sword magical now?
* Apparently some of the cutlery stuff doesn't bug him anymore, but he's really big on following the rules of the city. Apparently he's in some kind of gang, and in a gang war. But might be in the Blackstaff's gang? Mystra only knows how that one happened.
* This gang he's with is pretty weird too. Inludes that rude dwarf and greedy tortle, apparently a minotaur, and who knows what else. I guess I'll find out tomorrow.
