## Session 16
* Destro goes shopping
* Goof troop continues the nimblewright investigation
  * Find that Lord Deslintir's daughter bought the nimblewright, and uses it for sparring partner
    * Daughter looks like a swashbuckler. Fancies herself an adventurer? Hermione.
      * She wants adventure in her life. Seems bored. Tries to insert herself into our quest as well.
    * Offers to let us inspect it in exchange for a sparring session with Krull
    * Clairovoyant spell present
    * Sniff test: Metallic.
    * Visually: Doesn't even seem scuffed from swordplay or anything. Very hard/resilient metal making up its body. No signs of anything larger
  * House of wonders - Mage Academy in a Mystra temple. Sea ward.
    * They have taken theirs apart, and are in fact talking about the piece with the clairovoyant spell on it
  * House of Graces - Castle Ward - Teaches etiquette to young ladies.
* Asking Dhar Narg's children more about the nimblewright they saw
  * Didn't see the front of it. Nothing crazy in the back. Seemed to have hair, same color as the rest of him. Brassy colored. One thinks he might have seen a mustache -- Implies the Gralhund's are the one to investigate next
* Search for Quinze
  * Krull finds him, gets a whisper in his mind about it not being too late for him at the Emerald Conclave
* Long rest

## Todo:
* Ask seller about the clairovoyant pieces
* See Gralhund's about their Nimblewright
* Open the blackstaff's pouch (Krull)
