## Session 10
* Cat doing temple survey to try screwing Hope
  * Mechanical bird, appears to be from a member of the temple - Cat doesn't bother checking what temple it is
* Main party reconvenes in Blackstaff's room
  * She has spoken with Deville and Renair, and is out of breath.
  * Prophecy was what seems good becoming evil. Points out we all kind of fit that bill if we're working with the Zhents
  * She spoke to the wise man, didn't get much more. But he did at least say we're not *the* evil. Though we are both saviors and bringers of destruction.
    * Savior and destruction are two sides of a coin
  * Her decision is one of us will be magically compelled to act in a way that will put an end to the city's fighting, whilst reporting our doings every other day. Failure to follow will have problematic consequences
    * Failure to comply will feel as though your mind is splitting itself apart (5d10 psychic damage)
    * Applies spell to Maxi
* We try to see Deville, he was taken by guards. Yagra with him.
* Main party goes to armory next
  * Nimblewright is in the sparring field, sparring with others
  * Knows nothing of bomb making. Knows nothing of brothers. Doesn't know of other Nimblewrights. Was sparring here during the explosion by our house. Doesn't think it could damage a house, but unknown.
    * Owned by the city guard, can be given any order by any member.
    * Can be ordered to damage property or injure people, though it has not been before.
    * Unknown if it can use magic items
      * It is able to use one of our sending stones
  * Identify: Clairvoyance spell effecting it
    * Guards were unaware of this, ask us to leave. We should inform the Blackstaff.
  * They bought it at the docks, it wasn't officially sanctioned
    * Got it from a captain at the docks, runs a Carnival. 25k gold
* Thorbert returns to Dhar Narg with no message. No idea if he found Deville or not. Leads him to Yawning Portal. Seems like he didn't find anything.
  * Dhar Narg attempts and fails to track
* Morune worships Ricky Rat, potentially a demon. Screams in Morune's head at the sight of unapproved/unlicensed imagery that is reminiscent of him.
  * Clan headquarters: Evereska (near the great waste, Greycloak Hills). Asks her to send a courier there to work out licensing fees. She tells him to go do it at home

* Dera finally talks to Deville
  * Acuses us of ratting him out. Points out it was Dera's squires who did so.
  * Calls off the various deals given that he can't trust us
  * Reveals he is magically bound to avoid helping Dhar Narg. Implies Dhar can still be helped if Deville is unaware of the help being provided
* Carnival float - People seem to be having fun
  * Captain Zord - Back ship. The Eyecatcher. Is selling nimblewrights for 25k
