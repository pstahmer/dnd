## Session 22
* The pet thing Krull likes seems to be eating the metal helmet thrown to him, and it is rapidly rusting. No interest when silver coin thrown in
* More help blocking the door, hear a brief pause, followed by sounds of injuries.
  * The door then takes a massive hit as the Minotaur takes it down, seemingly attempting to escape
* Up the stairs, into the sewers. Come across a patrol of Gazers + Kobolds
  * Shots seem to go through Tesnor, just as one of the traps earlier did. He does seem to get lifted and slammed into a wall though
  * daggers come out of the middle of his body towards two of the gazers
  * Turns out to be a tall fancy drow w/ a rapier and a cape. He shuffles something into his hand after removing his hat and disappears. May have been in Sahein's group earlier in the atrium room
  * Find a grate out
* Appear to have gotten out on a side-street that may be abandoned. A few folks nearby, just not many
* Debrief w/ blackstaff
  * Illusion guy may be Jarlaxle, who is apparently a Drow leader (very unusually, a male one) who has an Army. Likely Sahein was with him earlier for some reason
  * Dhar Narg might have an army after him? Convinces blackstaff that Sahein is a king with an army after him.
  * Not displeased with us entirely, but would have liked more info on the leaders
  * Suggests the pet thing is a Rust Monster, common in underground mines. Can not consume magical metal, so a warforged would be safe in its presence.
* Resting at the tower instead of our home
  * Pidgey researches Rust Monsters - Metal that touches it, even to strike breaks
    * Potentially tame-able? Have some historical instances of this
  * Dhar Narg shares w/ Krull that he and his brothers are Sahein's _entire_ village. It was the full warband eating, roughly 500 elves
  * Draumar does some armor exchanging with the damaged plate he scavenged
  * Quinze reads about fairy tales of the fey
