## Session 23
### Meta
* Renair's necklace looked like an uber-round Ruby, possibly an Eye of the Stone of Galore. Was taken when he was kidnapped
  * The kenku warehouse was where we had rescued him
  * Snake w/ flying wings - Zhentarim
* Dagobert: Xanathar's raided the Zhentarim lair, left the Kenku behind to wipe out any remaining

### Session
* We send Dera's children to scout out the city and try to find us more Zhentarim symbols. Instruct them not to go inside when they find one. We also tell them not to try to watch the area, just inform us
* Draumar splits from the party to get drunk at the library
* Boats! Following up on the ship the note-passer followed a contact to. Part of the Drow connection
  * Hal (magic item salesman) is present and running a game booth
  * Lots of carnival games, food stalls, wild "monsters" doing tricks, etc
    * This is all on the raft, not the ship
  * Are told the captain is not entertaining guests
* Yawning portal
  * Deville says he can give us locations of some suspected hideouts of the other Zhentarim hideout, but only in exchange for getting his Geas from the blackstaff removed
  * Draumar inquires about a port city past the yawning portal, and how to get to it. Shares that he was given a vision (seeming by the Xanathar leader) to get info about Jarlaxle down there
  * Jarix walks out after speaking with Deville
* Blackstaff
  * Morume requests impounding the three ships by the carnival platform for spying upon the city
  * Jarix explains the Deville Geas deal. She says "I'll take care of it" and that it won't be long
* Hal
  * Play his game for the chance to win a magical item! See a stack of coins next to him, showing  how hard to win the game is
  * He was planning on hiring adventurers to go down there anyways and deal with growing unrest. So much unrest it's even bleeding over the surface realm
    * Says he thought the village he wanted us to look into was related
    * Says he's not sure we could handle it on our own without his assistance. Implies the village task was for us to prove ourselves
* Blackstaff enters the yawning portal, and walks right to the back w/o breaking stride. Points out that part of Deville's deal was to support the stability of the city. Offers to rewrite the deal if he's unhappy with the current state of things. To be more advantageous for herself, of course.
  * He describes a few locations:
    * Ma and Pa shop in southest of town (House L2)
    * An old abandoned tower in the Castle Ward (notes it has been raided by guards in the past)
    * 7 masks Theater
* Party decides to go to First Warehouse, and suggests telling Hal we want to go in a day or two
  * Pass Without A Trace in back alley
  * House is occupied, woman in a chair in front of a fire, parusing various documents
  * Flying snake comes through opposite window, goes into room w/ lady. Carrying a note
  * Knock the woman out, start rifling through notes
    > Zorbaag: Gather the usual gang, kidnap Fenris Stormcastle who lives on Quill Alley. He is known to be an associate of the newcomers to the Grand Game. Get whatever information you can out of him. --Manshoon
      * Fenris is the notepasser we previously interrogated
    * In the corner we see a nest of 3 flying snakes.
    * Other notes on people and what they know. This is an information station and/or interrogation hub.
      * Of particular note, we find a few that mention:
        * The seven masks theater is noted as a place that has been getting some attention. Uncertain why. Might be invovled in the gang war even though no fighting has taken place there as of yet. Possible gathering point?

## Next session
* Interrogate the woman
* Undermountain
* Follow up on Zhenatarim info, give to blackstaff, find Piece of Galore
