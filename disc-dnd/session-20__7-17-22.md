## Session 20
* Boss refers to drow as treaturous and prisoners he is forcing to fight
  * Dhar narg starts exhibition match against them
  * They seem dressed differently than the other drow, much more ragged
* Tournament
  * Each tournament will have champions fight 2 rounds, plus a possible bonus match. Each tourney has only 4 competitors (individuals/groups)
  * Dhar Narg wins his first round, pre-emptively accepts the challenge round
  * One of the drow separate from the rest, the others and Sahein are still in the petrify room (X18)
* Boss more or less tells us he recognizes our minotaur, and he _strongly_ suggests Dhar Narg take the special challenge round
* Darkness spell!
