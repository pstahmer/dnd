## Session 7
* Pidgey's rock seems to have runes on it
* We go up to the tavern, it is now sometime in the day. At least a few hours have passed
* Runestone is imbued with wild magic -- A keyword will activate it, roll 1d100 for outcome -- No attunement necessary
  * worth: 50 gp
* Bracelet - Attunement - Immunity to petrification, allows casting of flesh to stone up to 3 times (TOTAL).
  * Can then cast Stone Shape 13 times
  * worth: 200gp -- Possibly cursed?
* Sending stones
  * Worth: 400gp
* Yagra hears us mention Deville, goes to back room to fetch him
  * Deville heard about us rescuing the lordling. Has a side business he thinks Dhar Narg might be interested in.
  * Represents the Zhentarim. A different chapter of which entered the city and started the gang war. Was not his group. They wish to stop this, by whatever means necessary
  * Elven & half-elven sailors are being decapitated in the night. Offers gold reward for successfully solving/stopping/capture. 200gp
  * Provides flying snake that can deliver messages back to him
    * Dhar Narg names him Thorbert
* Joster Silvermane stops Druamar on the way out
  * Looking for adventurers to assist the Open Lord
  * Offering paying missions. One time offer.
  * Exiled adventurers who tried to bribe a magistrate. Seem to be inciting violence. It's a pair, they recruit Kenku in the docks. Kill them. Quietly.
* Arrow quest
  * Haven't seen arrow like this in 80 years. Came out of a village of renowned archers that was ransacked. Unpopular because of how hard it is to hit a target. Can be made again
  * -2 to hit, + 1d4 damage
  * Come back in a few hours or a day to get pricing info
* Bar negotiation
  * No idea about cost for bullet 1
  * Dungsweeper's guild, Innkeeper's guild?, Tavernskeeper's guild, Entertainer's guild/council of musicians
    * 50/50
  * Right of first offer - Upon proof of death, ownership transfers to state, who the sale proceeds would then go to
  * 15% interest / month, 2 months until profits are garnished until repayment
    * This is slightly under half his originally offered rates
  * 2/3 vs 1/3 split in his favor on profits, renegotiating if he has to put up front cost in
    * We need to bring 5 patrons on opening night
    * We will hire a bard
* Nightfall - Bars - Drunk half-elf, knifey figure running at him, blade drawn.
  * Knifey figure is Elven, Drow.
  * "they deserve death". "Surface elves took our home and forced us into the underground. Why wouldn't we hate them?"
    * Take a gun off of him. Has 4 pouches of "smoke powder"
  * Capture him and bring to Deville. Not a fan of the fact that we were seen bringing him in here
    * Mentions concern of additional trouble if we deal with him inside the city
  * Takes us to small hut outside the River Gate
    * His agents will come by to find out if the drow was acting alone. We'll know in the morning, and be paid accordingly
* Hear an explosion downstairs when we wake in the AM
  * Big hole in the side of our building, remnants of burns around the sides
  * 2 bodies outside
  * Bumo implied it was a Fireball spell
