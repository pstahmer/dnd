## Session 13
* The blobs who say "Meep!" engage us
  * Kobolds run away
  * Big mama blob
  * Mimic in the next room, tricks and traps Krull and Jarix
    * Quinz falls deeply in love with the mimic
    * Jarix deals the finishing blow... After we put it back to sleep
    * 500 GP + a note. Jarix and Krull pocket the 500 instead of party funding?
