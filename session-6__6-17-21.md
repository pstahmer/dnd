## Session 6
* Xanavor tells Ephram he sold wagon and no pigs survived, giving him 30gp.  Can tell his family now that House Kyel is not to be trifled with since bandits robbed them and all ended up dead.  He accepts.

* Plantlife acting weird. Moss by cave entrance instead of grass, dead tree outside
  * Resolved: Seems to be due to natural necromancy from Nethrise tomb
* Pushed open door, trap. Fought spectre inside, ambushed by goblin and half-ogre when leaving
  * Animated sword guarding chest, which had some jewelry in it
* Found some tracks
