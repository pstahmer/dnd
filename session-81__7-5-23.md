## Session 81
* Half a day out from Red Larch: Chad missing in the night. Took his gear and horse w/ him. Note left behind for Finliph:
  > Be back in a few days. Need to take care of some cat business. Hugs and kisses, Chad
  * Footprints leading away, looks like something was starting to be written in the dirt. A couple of arcane symbols, but incomplete.
  * A few cat footprints here and there.
  * All footprints lead to horse, seems like he took his time
  * Leaves the darkglobe behind w/ us
* Sinkhole questions:
  * Dwarven ruins under it?
  * Floating stones relation?
* All Faiths Shrine
  * Has gone from being a cozy small building to the center of a cluster of tents. See some recognizable faces among them
  * We're watched as we approach. None really say anything, seem defensive around outsiders (we're disguised)
  * Priest of Mystra comes out. Tells us the town has been destroyed. Several great calamaties have befallen the area
    * Kai introduces us as Hugh (manatee), Elvis, and Huckleberry
  * The Sheriff is among the dead, from the raids?!
    * Maybe 40 people in total remain at this point
  * One of the Tarnlarrs survived, Maegra (the wife). He goes to fetch her
* Maegra Tarnlarr
  * Looks leaner, and a bit dirtier. Has been busy but also mourning
  * She describes what has happened:
  > We awoke one day to a strange man coming into town, saying something about the strength of the earth and timelessness of mountains. Then he threw something upon the ground, everything shook, and our town was destroyed. More were injured than killed, and thankfully we had a priest to help heal.
  * Says they haven't been able to get word out to the alliance.
  * A week or two later people started coming from the east. Some flying on great birds, others on foot. They captured many, killed more, ran off with whoever they could. Her husband was killed trying to defend the town.
  * A month ago the tremors started again. These ones were smaller, but grew bigger every night. These demolished all the efforts to rebuild. Couldn't build enough in a day to stay up in the night. A week ago the great hole in the center of town swallowed all that was left of the town center.
  * A few days ago they started seeing their friends again. Her husband for a moment. An image, a shadow at night wearing their faces. They come at night then disappear. People started crowding for a chance to see their loved ones, then eventually two nights ago they started attacking. Just a touch was enough to fell a man. They seemed to come from the hole. Tried to fight them but their weapons were no good. Only the priest has been able to keep them back with his wardings.
  * A shadow the size of a building headed south
  * They go further every night
  * Another Adventurer came this morning, said her name was Fanny. A slender woman. Wandered in alone and seemed fine w/ the heat. She's dressed like a maid
  * The problems started 2 days after we vanished.
  * Kai thinks some of her delivery is slightly off, but can't tell if it's just grief
* Sinkhole
  * Appears to have some caves or caverns
  * Dressed as a maid
  * (Voiced by Ken) - Asks who we are
  * Was asked to meet here. Looking for a man. Tall, beard, smokes a lot, absolutely mental
    * Doesn't mean he's bad, just odd.
    * Insight: We think she might have asked Chad to meet here?
    * Chad is her uncle, claims they've been sending letters back and forth. And that he has something of hers. She asked where they could meet, he said here.
      * Says she saw/met him in Candlekeep as a young adult. Looks 25 now
* Go to the quarry to enter the tunnels/sinkhole
  * Halforc resting on a barrel of pickles
    * Kai embraces him, despite the disguise
  * Fannie followed us. Says she wants Chad's cookbook. Which Xano has
* Moving stone room: They're moved all to the south.
  * Some mummified remains seem to have been moved, but there are no footprints down here other than our own
  * We make our way to the sinkhole. We're 60-70 ft under surface. Several hundred feet left to go down
  * Stone in the final room, around the center. Cylindrical, floating at eye level. Below it is a hole into the sinkhole
    * Stone can move in any direction, re-centers its horizontal position but seems to stay wherever it is vertically moved
    * Stone drops when Finliph steps up to it. Seems to stop falling when he steps off that tile. No other floor tiles seem to have an impact
    * Stone sounds like it hits the bottom as Kai stands on the tile
* We get to bottom of sinkhole
  * Lots of debris, and some bodies
  * Four tunnels nearby that we can see. The largest is also the deepest, we go in it (15ft from bottom)

* Seeming should last until after nightfall

## Todo next time
* Ask Peryoal if the Tarnlarrs had a way to get a message out without merchants/messengers
*
