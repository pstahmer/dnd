## Session 43
* Chad firebolts by a light, something shakes loose off the statue and the light recedes a little further into the cave
* Finliph runs in, resists cold, finds a central chamger with a solitary stone structure. Possibly a sarcophagus.
  * Door slams shut as he gets to it. The rest of us stuck outside. The cover moves, and begins to open. A gentleman steps out
  * The flames all go out
  * The temperature drops still further
  * Man starts as a skeleton, but as he rises flesh starts to fold on him. Hair starts to grow, etc.
    * "I return from the warrior's rest, to find my tomb burned, the bones desecrated. Those who have done this are not here."
    * Draws a greatsword
    * Name is Javor Uthgardt - Has been granted brief reprieve to hunt the desecrators - Revenant.
      * Says the farmer and son "burned it"
    * Killing a Revenant doesn't stop it. They will keep regenerating until their vengeance is complete
  * Door was shut with transmutation
    * Xano blows a hole in the door, we shout to Finliph, he calls "HELP"
  * We hear hooves coming up upon us as we try the door
    * Barbarian horde - Elk tribe
    * They engage us. 10 peons, 2 named ones. Padraich and Fennor
  * Javor comes out, orders all barbarians to lower weapons
  * He eventually stops the combat
* Javor Wants to go off and kill son
  * Asks Kai why he is kin but not defending Javor's grave
  * Asks what happened to Kai's tribe, the woman he asks simply bows her head and stays silent - Implying it was simply because they were weak
  * Javor says he will allow Kai to handle the vengeance, but will come for him if Kai fails.
    * Kai had suggested converting the boy to the Uthgar ways
