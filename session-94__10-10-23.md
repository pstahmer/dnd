## Session 94
* Baro saw who he thought was his daughter, but when he got close the illusion dropped and it was someone else
* He saw this child on an altar, near a portal, in the middle of a ritual being done by the other priests
  * 3 stones jutting up into the air. Storm of lightning in the middle, booming thunder in the cavern. Just below it is an altar where they had a little girl tied. Around it are chanting priests, apparently for days on end
* We approach the ritual, alpha strike
  * We get _wrecked_
  * Kai goes ethereal at one point during the fight and sees Yan See Bin with his face pressed up against the portal
  * Kai goes through the portal as a distraction, sees that Yan See Bin is Huge, and the portal is 10ft. This appears to be why he can't fit through
  * Xano follows him, and uses the amulet of planes to try shifting them both back to redlarch. He fails, sending them to a random location on Faerun, possibly _with_ Yan See Bin
