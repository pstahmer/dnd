## Session 10
* Bought armor
* Reported to Sheriff
  * Only suggestion was to send word to waterdeep
* Report to LA
  * Instantaneous reporting via some magic item
* Returning on a Saturday - Check out temple
* Check on if potions are ready (Temple, LA)

* Genie rest
  * Symbol quality matters, exact replicas taking time have implications
  * Asks about Kai
    * Says our fates are tied together
    * Refuses to elaborate
  * Kai gets a tingle when Xanavor enters/leaves the Genie's realm

* Shrine investigation
  * Saw someone, they ran off
  * Followed to a wagon, found a hidden door
  * Door lead to cavern, large room with a 10ft stone door. Opened surprisingly easy. Some kind of hinge, thick stone, but no check to get it open.
  * Door lead to hallway with 4-way intersection. The hall we're following, as well as a stone door of the same size on each side
  * North door: has a bend to the east after 50ft or so. Rats ahead, closed stone door behind us to muffle sound
    * 5 rats. The give Kai some nibbles before we put 'em all down
      * Okay, a lot of nibbles
    * 5/7 MM charges left after the fight
    * Hex still active for ~55m
