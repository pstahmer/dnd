## Session 51
* Have had utter silence since being told to go to the water temple. Ring seems empty. No temperature fluctuations on the ring, no signal that the magic is still there. But abilities are not impacted.
* Feels like the last bit and remnant of the family has left him

## Session 7 - 6/24/21
* Genie is a little condescending, but also kind
* Genie Rises out of the cloud from the hookah
  * Dark skin, glamorous, pure white eyes, vest, linen shorts, wears a matching ring to the one I have
* Ask about the blue orb
  * He calls it a common trinket, which produces light.
  * When he handles it it produces a glow, he speaks a word I don't understand and it starts floating. At another word it begins to give off bright light. From cool and ambient to sharp and daylight-quality. It lowers back to a calm light at another word
  * I ask for command words, he agrees
    * "owh mah" awma - Float
    * "wa haaj" wahaj - Small light
    * "no are" Nawar - Daylight
* Broken eye symbol - He has seen it, it was the reason he saved me
  * Eldritch being's symbol - It brings death, whereas the genie brings life
    * A dangerous being -- Kai seeks this being
    * The death of my family was both an order and a whim, for it and its followers
  *

* Called into the ring forcibly after arranging bodies into the eye symbol
  * "You do not know what it summons"
  * Sketch matters little


* Kai hesitated to return the ring after a combat ploy that involved me hiding in it
  * He desires the one ring!

* Ajwa did not visit Kai
* Our connection has been complicated of late
  * Ever since the resurrections of Kai
  * Borrowed power from another. Bringing life to the dead wasn't something he could do. Bargained a favor for it
    * Yan See Bin's power
* Windharrow is in the same direction as Kai's goal, but is not this being's goal. And does not have Kai's best interest at heart
* Yan see bin being seeked out under there. Windharrow is too close to get alone
  * Do sacred stone first. Destroying the monks there might give sufficient power to face Yan see bin
  * Yan See Bin would kill us all if we didn't escape first
* Can make my ring cold if we're doing something he deems a good idea




* Did dragons wreak havoc 1000 years ago? Dwarves were ruined by one, look up in waterdeep


## Session 63 visit
* Familiar genie in the center on the bench with the hookah
* Seems to be in high spirits
  * Claims they've been ignoring him more of late
  * "Not having literal big brother look over your shoulder is a good thing"
  * Insight: He does seem slightly worried, but in weirdly high spirits. Feeling more free than he has in some time, which matches his nature as an Air spirit. Xano does think this is the real Ajwa
* Father knew of his existence but didn't _really_ know what he had. Was still a family heirloom though. More than 1000 years
* Didn't remember much of the past until being around his brother again. Seeing the machinations.
  * Neither of us is sure if that's normal
* As soon as they were certain I was gone and not coming back, their alliances fell apart. They are fighting each other again now and ignoring us
  * Cautions Xano: If you take them on, do it one at a time
* The red larch detonation angered Aerisi, who has tried to extend control further east
  * Orcs may be related? Or a distraction?
* They don't know we're back!
  * Imix of Fire knows, since we messed Vannifer
* Kai's little girl is not dead, but not a little girl anymore. He may want to hurry.
* They don't know all the rituals to bring Yan See Bin across. But they're learning quickly. Also need a host, they may use the mother and/or daughter
* Doesn't know of a way to purify the bond other than defeating Yan See Bin and his forces, but replacing the ring _may_ work. Would be better if Ajwa was at full power but it could be a way to free myself of part of this when we attack. But doing so also may be the thing that tips them off to our return.
* Corruption is essentially magical overflow, excess, etc. Energy leaking out of their portals and influencing the plane in unnatural ways. Prepares the area for their arrival
* Charisma check: Pass - Think I got in and out without anybody noticing. Potentially advantage as long as they don't know, but DC rises each time. Long gaps can potentially lower the DC again

* Eldritch invocation swaps:
  * Level 8: Swap Devil's Sight for Mask of Many Faces, Mire the Mind, or
  * Level 9: Gift of the Protectors
    * Kai
    * Fin
    * Fanny
    * Chad
  * Far scribe:
    * Fanny
    * Fin
    * ~~Kai~~ -- Baro Gladham
    * Peryoal
  * Level 9: Swap for Sign of Il Omen? - 8h non-concentration curse
