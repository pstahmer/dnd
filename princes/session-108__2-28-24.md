## Session 108
* Climb the mountain
* Come across cave
  * Giant lair
  * Stone Giant, very depressed. Invites us to share in the dream. The snow has come and will fade, as will we all. Sit by the fire and dream with us
    * Stories of (stone) Giants that are exceptionally long-lived, even more so than elves. Sometimes become DreamWalkers. They lose their recognition between dreams and reality, and are overcome with depression, anwe, barely keep themselves alive. Dangerous because while less violent, their age and nature give them an aura of those feelings that can catch you as easily as a club
  * Warns us to be careful of the Coven if we're going up the mountain
  * Tells of 4-5... somethings up the mountain. Make that 3, he smashed one.
  * It says "It's a shame they didn't stay, I could have shown them a shortcut"
