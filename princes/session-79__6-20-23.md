## Session 79
* Statues on the ends of the arena have gems, if you socket them into the central statue's eyes it'll open an item stash for you, usually containing a useful item.
* Gethmedra introduces the fight. Bhun "Stonecutter" gets crowd chants and applause. Introduces Xano and Finliph by name.
  * Xano not a fan
  * Champions of Chimaera: Goat (Pike, hand crossbow), Lion (Claws), Dragon (Flaming maul, firebreath)
* Statue prizes: Potion of greater healing, Potion of Fire resistance, Gold-ish potion
* As we win, Gethmedra calls the fight disappointing and says not to worry, they have something special planned! The star of the night: an actual fucking chimaera.
* We win again, Bhun's freedom is won!
