## Session 65
* Something something room, something something orb of vacuum spirits, something something fire elemental
* Cracked Orb's Vaccuum portal started sucking Chad in when he was bleeding out on the ground
  * Necromancy suffuses the entire room
* Bahumut doors on the ground
  * Celestial: Beseeching Bahamut and asking his blessing
  * Draconic: Invoking for protection wards in his name
  * Other sides: Less draconic about warding, more a description that this is a door to Celestia and the realm of Bahumut
* Fire elemental was a Myrmadon
* Think orb happens to be present, but portal is the source of the necromancy. Portal on ground, orb floating above it
  * Some motes of energy getting sucked into orb instead of portal
  * Mage hand on the orb: It resists, but is able to pull it somewhat away. Feels like an elastic force, snaps eventually and the orb comes flying into Chad's chest
    * Portal stays stationary, does not appear to be expanding. However the two doors on the ground are being pulled towards it
    * Chad and Xano appear to lurch forward for a moment, almost like a mirror image lurching into them. Xano has 14pts of life sucked into portal
* Portal re-routed? Why necromancy relating to Celestia? Why necromancy w/ Bahamut's protections?
* Orb has no glyphs or runes
* Black spiral storm in the orb, cracks along outside seem like they were worse before, but have been mended
  * Doesn't absorb mage hands or minor illusions
* Chad Dispel Magic's the protal. Spell gets sucked in, portal starts to shrink and disappear. Shrinks down to ~1ft diameter portal
* Drag a door over the now 1ft diameter portal
  * Metal bends and creaks, a small divit appears in the door. Second door shakes and vibrates a bit but seems stable
  * Portal room has arcane glyphs on the 8 corners of the room
    * Oooold magic. Portal glyphs. All have been changed from original form.
    * Fey and undead within a mile
* Orb out of necromancy room: Mostly evocation, some conjuration as well
  * Puella - Darkness bubble!!
  * Have Chad identify in the AM
