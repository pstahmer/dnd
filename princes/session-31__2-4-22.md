## Session 31
* Red larch!
  * All faiths shrine: Elf serving Tyr - God of Law and Justice (same as at Summit Hall)
    * Knows a little of Yan See Bin - Says the cult was long ago eradicated, after causing much ill. Old elemental god
    * Asks about Kai's visions - Gets told one potential answer is it being subconcious dreams. Also could be a mask to an ulterior motive from the one who gave it
      * Waking visions are extremely rare. Drugs can help induce. Altered perception of reality is usually the key element. True waking visions are however possible. Items can help cause it
      * Ajwa is a Nethrise name meaning "air"
  * Sheriff: Not much
  * Lord's Alliance:
    * No update on goblins, someone sent to scout but haven't heard back yet
    * Check the inn and the bar for viable companions
  * Helm at high sun:
    * 4 sellswords, drinking but not drunk. 1 is particularly shady. 2 fighter, 1 rogue, 1 caster
    * Kai looks concerned about going to earth cult first
    * Promised 15gp ea, 10gp per survivor on return
* Kai: "I just don't want Yan See Bin to get you" "nevermind"
  * To Finliph: I talked to you about this, how Xanavor's being influenced by Yan See Bin
  * Xano: Ajwa told me the same, but about you
  * Kai says he was told while not having the ring
  * Fin was burned by it, Xano reveals Ajwa claims to only be able to make it colder
    * Xano also reveals that Ajwa had to borrow power from one stronger than himself to revive
  * Xano remembers his family died to fire, the ring was always cooling
* Priest in AM: Payment yet to be made for the pact, for the revival of Kai
  * Detect evil cast by priest: Both seek their own personal gain, both through favors owed
    * Xanavor's aura is clouded, attempting to hide what it is
    * Kai's aura is true in its intent and goals, but does not seek to harm him in its process
    * Between us: Connected
  * Advice: Approach only that which you know, and save the unknown for later
* Kai reassures Xano that his instincts are good, and he is generally good. Trust himself
