## Session 20
* Loot: Just their gear
* Check rooms, decent quarters but all empty. Go upstairs, open locked door, it's an ambush
  * Finliph 1 roll from death, fight not going great for us
  * Xanavor cheese inspiration cards + bottled respite
  * They meet Ajwa
    * Sword of Nulasemar has untapped power. Requires growth and introspection to fully tap into
    * Ajwa is 1200 years old
    * Shares a bit about the cults
      * Yan see bin is an ancient elemental, very powerful
        * This is likely a guardpost. They probably have a full base somewhere nearby
          * Likely visible from tower, they likely can send messages back and forth
      * Black earth likely backed by an equally old and powerful elemental
        * The catacombs likely go deeper than Kai was able to find
      * Fire and water are somewhere out there
      * The eye is out there somewhere as well
        * Undeath is sometimes seen as the fifth element. The natural end of the other 4.
    * Market days are rare, Red Larch is the only large one
      * Gladhams are well respected ranchers in the livestock trade, big players.
      * Dignitaries going missing would destabilize
    * Even elementals crave power. Don't underestimate what they might do to get it back.
      * Could be serving the undeath as a way to gain it
    * Advises us to pay more heed to the gods we worship in the coming days
      * The gods stole power from the elementals to create this plane. This could make them natural enemies of these ancient elementals

* Return to tower, engage guards on bridge. Body swap occurs
  * Hex active
  * 3 charges left on MM wand

## Goals
* Return to the spire, clear it, capture the LT.
  * Discover the true feathergale stronghold
