* Back to town - Market day!!
  * Kai reports to Sheriff Harbruk
    * Sheriff remembers the necromancer, "aurel, aureoth" something like that
      * Standoffish, didn't want to talk, kept saying "he'll be here soon"
    * Vouched for Xanavor + Finliph
    * Asked to watch out for more undead, and if any other oddities happened in past year
    * Cairn road update: Fella came through saying he was robbed. Saw where they went, nearby. Wagon in the woods. Name: `Efram`, dresses in red, well kept, etc. Carries rapier

    * 1 healing pot

* Efram
  * House Ke-al - lower/nothing house from southern sword coast
    * Brokers for larger livestock trades, but not much direct power
  * Fire orange hair, crew cut, mousey look, red + silver decent clothing
  * Nervous fella
  * 2d ago - Was bringing 4 boars into town, got hit by bandits. 2-6 of them
  * Hid in a ditch, saw them go 100ft down road, fetched something, tree moved when they did, then they drove wagon into the woods
    * Near the burned out carriage
  * Bandits were human, one may have been HE,
  * Wagon has a seal on the side

* Ending ~1-2pm, early afternoon
  * Loose plan - Track down during day, ambush at night. This way nobody leaving market day gets hit
