## Session 90
* Spirits ask the rest of us to share our pain with our tribe.
* Afterward they have us join right hand to left wrist in a circle. We feel a bolt run through the connection, pain in our arms, searing in our tattoos
* We each take on a tribal name
  * Fanny - Magpie - Obsessed w/ the shiny, but good at taking what she wants
  * Xano - Peacock - Showy, protective of his people
  * Finliph - Crow - Uses tools, holds grudges, acts in keeping with them
* Attack was likely from a tribe in the east, by the high forest. More aggresive tribes over there

* Head to Feathergale spire
  * Tower is being rebuilt by slaves, two vultures w/ riders watching over them
  * Half a mile from the tower one rider peels off to approach us, then the other
  * We surprise them and take them out
  * Advance on the cave -- Find out it the entrance has collapsed!
    * Survival check: Footprints (fresh) going directly into the collapsed rocks, we quickly test and confirm that it's an illusion
* Howling Hatred Cave
