## Session 11
* Black stone, spherical, possibly granite, hovering 3ft off ground
  * Driftglobe float command does not disable it.
  * 1ft diameter
  * Set to 3 ft in the air. Can be lifted, comes back down
  * Moves freely to the side
  * After 5 ft drops to the ground, denting the ground
    * Try to roll it back, weighs like 30lb
    * When rolled back into the "field" it becomes weightless again
    * Detect magic: 10ft column of transmutation magic here, goes almost to ceiling, ~8ft tall.
      * Sphere is just a rock as far as we can tell
* Continue through to door that leads seemingly to where earlier hallway would terminate
  * Open door, see a profile of a figure, presumably a builder of this tunnel. Large, dwarven, 8ft tall statue on a 2ft plinth. Shield, battle axe, presumably some form of warrior. Some offerings on the ground around. Coins, gems, an ornate dagger w/ dark blue leather hilt.
    * Dagger is magical, basic enchantment. Possible abjuration. likely +1 dagger
    * Dwarf is Ironstar: Famous dwarf from antiquity. Known to protect the people, fate unknown
  * Kai sees footprints, some new, some old. All within last year
* Next door: Man standing there. Brown robes, white shirt, holding a torch. Human, late 40's.
  * Drops to his knees and holds his hands up in prayer
  * Says he ran in because we chased him. Then insists he ran because we were lurking about the entrance
    * Baragustas? Elder of the town, helped build much of it. Retired, drinks the day away. Soaks at the bathhouse. He's around a lot
  * "The temple of the standing stones"
    * They found it 10 years ago. Come down 1x/week. The next room holds the standing stones, which move. Through them they can divine the fates. Seem to often be correct
    * Somebody is in the next room, wanted to be alone
      * La'Rock - Their leader. A name that has only really come up in the last hour or so
        * Younger man, 20's, brown hair, accent, knowledgeable
        * Has been in town a couple years. Proved knowledgeable about the rocks and become the one in charge of the readings
        * Reads them by: position compared to previously, and presence or absence of drag marks
      * The rocks change every sat/sun, they come down to see and interpret. The last one was: they need to move people away from the northern hills. Mentions what happened to the Grahams
      * Sheriff is unaware
* Through the door: 4 bandits with crossbows. Shoot Baragustas for opening the door, also shoot at Finliph
  * Kill them, then hear a commotion on the other side of the stone room. Then some stone-on-stone grinding, sounds like a door
  * Chase across the room, some mummies, arms crossed over chest, etc.
  * Larrakh eventually comes out from the corner
    * Casts spells at us, double attacks, uses glaive
    * Dude was a friggin' tank
