## Session 74
* Dwarves don't appear to be in league with the lidless. Tell us to follow them when they realize Xano isn't trying to take the iron by force
* Take us to hidden entrance of a cave.
  * Strongly implied that Broadswain is still wandering the top of the mountain after trying to get them to just hand over all the iron without compensation
  * A lot of wounded in the cave. "What's left of the last time we tried to go in" a demon or something has taken over the mines
* Take us to Yorn, who appears to be royalty. Finely appointed, but wounded.
  * Demons of stone took the caves, a surprise attack. To defend the caves you need to activate the guardians
  * They provide a map, which marks where the various guardians are. Stars are guardians. Each has a command word, written above their star. Ancient spirits of the earth that protect the tribe
    * Falling stone mine
    * Earth elementals
  * 2 months since the invasion began. Only a dozen dwarves remain
    * Most were outside when the invasion began, thus they couldn't activate the guardians
  * Snake haired vile woman of magic leading them, don't look into her eyes
* Near the cave entrance we find a petrified Broadswain, seemingly frozen mid-swing
* In the mine we find a cart, Finliph rides it into a horrific accident. This seems to bring a burrowing creature to attack us
  * We fight it off, kill it as it flees. It hits like a _truck_ though
  * TODO? Thick thick armor, could make good armor eventually if we harvest it on the way out
* After much steam and pain, we faintly hear hammer and pickaxes against stone, the sounds of shouts as well. Overseers?
  * 15ft gap/crevasse between us and the noise. but track continues over it
  * Dwarves seem to be working essentially as slave labor. Mining.
    * 3-4 Gargoyles watching them to the west
      * Molten trough with another Gargoyle watching more dwarves. Seemingly the foundry
    * 1 Gargoyle guarding a door to the east
    * Track continues to the south
  * We think the door is to the office this is room one, the foundry we only started seeing
* Plan: Finliph to stealth to first guardian (Ijol), attempt to activate. The rest of us attack the front Gargoyle as soon as we hear it
