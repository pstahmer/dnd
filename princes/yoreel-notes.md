### NPC's
1. Elf Yoreel supported: Caeleath
2. Elf who won: Jaseanavin

### Magical effects
1. Programmed Illusions - Reminder, can only trigger 1x/10m
    1. A dice cup that hides 4 of the 5 die and replaces them with 6's if Yoreel specifically scratches the bottom while shaking the cup before a roll
    2. A stone that creates the sound of applause starting throughout the 30ft area if it is at least 30 feet from Yoreel and can hear him say the phrase "What do you think of that?"
    3. His rapier will trigger an illusion if it is being wielded and he says the phrase "Take this!".  That illusion is of his sword stabbing out towards the target faster and faster, while sunlight glints off the seemingly multiple points to add to the confusion (my attempt to get a once per combat advantage on a melee attack, feel free to veto)
    4. A coin purse that will appear to be full of stones, screws and nails if opened after Yoreel says the phrase "not that there's much to show", and convert the sound of coins clinking to sound more like the fake contents (rule check)?
    5. His cloak is enchanted so that if he says the phrase "You're not going to hit me!" and jumps to the side (i.e. dodge action), he will appear to split in half and form a clone as he moves. That clone will then lunge at his attacker with its rapier. (Also an attempt to get advantage on attack roles, though only when preceded with a dodge action and attack against him. Would fire off illusion regardless of if he's hit or not)
    6. A stone tucked into his belt that will create a fog cloud if tossed and hits the ground
    7. A belt buckle marked with a stick figure that if I say "time to run!" creates a dozen illusory copies of myself that appear to all run in a pack with me

### Quest
1. Recover Nulasemar's sword
    1. On my way to Summit Hall, I knew he was interred there to gain honor in the human world
    2. On the journey south before reaching it, Yoreel notices quite a bit of smoke in the sky. From the direction of the road, not of the forest. I think it's likely that something has happened at summit hall
    3. Summit hall is overwhelmed with tents and encampments. The smoke appears to have been from campfires and also from summit hall itself. Tents appear to all be orcish. Likely numbering 800-1000 orcs
        1. Most of the smoke appears to be large bonfires just outside the fort. They don't appear to have breached the walls yet, but they clearly have attacked at some point and are holding tight right now
        2. No visible siege equipment. Orcs likely trying to take it by storming the walls
        3. Fires appear to be burning bodies, easily a couple hundred
    4. Yoreel skirts around the encampment as widely as he can, and continues onto Bargewright inn
    5. Continue on to Bargeright to get proper drunk after seeing that shit
2. Support Caeleath

### Long-term Magical items wanted:
1. Ring of spell storing - 24k - rare
2. Weapon? Fancier armor? Instrument?

## Plot updates
* Finds out Finliph has the sword. Sends letter to Caeleath with Illusory Script (10d duration)
* Real message:
> Caeleath, my quest nears its end, albeit with a couple complications. There's an orcish siege around Summit Hall, and the sword already has a new owner. I think some new friends I've made have a solution for the former, I may require the help of some _loyal_ friends for the latter if you're ready to roll the die on this one. Its wielder is quite capable and doesn't necessarily share the army's views on the sword's purpose.
* Fake message:
> Caleath my friend, I know that snob Jaseanavin sent me on this most drudgerous quest for speaking out of line but I can't help but feel it has proven to exemplify his failures in leadership. For starters our knowledge of the orcish movements in the south was woefully outdated. Sumit hall finds itself under siege, with hundreds of orcs present. Luckily the man he sent is a master at making gambles pay off, even a bad bet. I have a plan to get myself beyond the lines of the siege, and likely back out as well. Unfortunately this is where I believe I will require assistance from the aforementioned snob. Could you beseech him to send a small platoon down to help escort me back incase the orcs give chase? I will likely be making my attempt within the week, but fear if I sent the request to him directly he'd dismiss it out of hand. Our people can't afford for the petty strife between he and I to cost this opportunity and push the sword into Orcish hands. Ever your loyal friend, Yoreel.
