## Session 16
* Camp a couple miles from Sacred stone monastery, with open fire.
  * Hear whispers, someone in dimmed platemail approaches - Actually it's made of stone
  * Very unfriendly to us, does not respond to almost any prompt except to tell us to leave
  * We push him too far, he does some kind of earth shock business to Finliph (shatter?)
  * Battle - 4 MM charges used
  * Cleric attacked us then ran, we spent the night chasing him down and killing.
* Finliph uses Tasha's Caustic Brew on the bodies to try disintegrating them
  * Go back to camp to long rest
  * Charges recovered: 4 - Back to full

## Goals:
1. Investigate Sacred Stone Monastery
2. Try to entice them to fight the Featherfolk?
