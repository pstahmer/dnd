## Session 101
* Fanny negotiates a release w/ the drow
  * 3 jobs, or 250k gp. Or some combination thereof, jobs each have values
    * Job 1: A courier named Bertram is transporting a chest that can only be opened if he freely gives it to you, and the drow can only open it if it is freely given to her. Upon failure to open, it teleports back to a mansion in waterdeep.

      * Must be delivered unopened

* Finliph - Drow chase
  * The rogue who was running doesn't break away, but a priestess shows up to help them
  * Horrig knocks out the rogue while Finliph continues chasing the priestess
  * Finliph ties up the drow priestess, ends up breaking her hands before being able to successfully intimidate her into agree to answer questions
    * Horrig casts Zone of Truth
    * She communicates that while a ship did stop here recently, she didn't see a person as part of the cargo
    * Confirms it was the right ship, is not nearby, is not sure where it is, is capable of getting to the place, laughs at the idea of us getting there.
  * Rogue
    * Nothing meaningful
  * Follow the wagon trail they were fleeing along
    * Leads up into some hills, river narrows into a stream. Eventually come up to the ruins of a mansion. Seems unoccupied.

  * Cell door opens, several guards plus Reyleth greet her, stating her gear is back by the portal

  * Teleporter drops her in the stables of the mansion the others are staying at
  * Meets up with the others, then Sending shenanigans ensues to catch everyone up
