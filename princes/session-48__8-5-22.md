## Session 48
* Back to horses, rest. Compound has been cleared (above ground)
* We wake up and see Gariana high as a kite, horses around her also stoned and actively entertaining her
* As we approach the castle again we hear the workers working.
* Give the workers 1 silver each to clean the bugbear room and wait for us
  * They are _extremely_ willing to continue working for us if we come out alive
  * Xano unsure what LA will think of a castle
* Go through river gate, see some stairs a short ways in. They lead after a bit to a stone door. Seems to be the basement of the castle
  * Go upstream for another hour or so. Just pitch black silence.
  * Occasional branch in the river, but none large enough for a rowboat. Seemingly just cracks in the wall
* Light ahead, flickering like a candle/torch but blue-green in color. Seems like it comes to a small underground lake. It also transitions from a cave to stonework, a carved floor meant to look like stone with steps that lead into the water
  * Slight Evocation magic in the air. Xano thinks it's from the light, not anything else
    * Bronze torch with stones in it
  * Large bricks re-enforcing carved out paths in the stone. Arched hallway
* Find a large door with a padlock, unlocked. Half a dozen straw pallets inside. Arrow slit, some water, rocks. Solid metal bar down the arrow slit
* Find a room with cots, more of those bronze stone laterns. 4 baddies on them.
* Merfolk fountain - Ancient. No water running through it. Arms missing, chest missing, damaged all around. Seems like all the statues in the room have been deliberately destroyed
* Room that smells of swamp and rotting fish. Animal pelts everywhere. Firepit. Several reptilian muscular lizardfolk. This appears to be their den
  * Hard fought battle, but eventually we brought all of them and their chief in
