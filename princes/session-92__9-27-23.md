## Session 92
* Aerisi must die for her crimes!
  * Kai's rage leads to a ~50dmg round
  * Xano succeeds in summoning the genie
  * As she dies: "You don't know what you just did"
    * Her body disappears, but all her posessions clatter to the ground
    * Genie vanishes, but we hear: "My friends! She is dead, or at least gone!"
  * Fight the remaining two invisible stalkers
* After combat
  * Aerisi drops: Belly dancer's outfit, Long Spear (magical?)
    * Long spear triggers wis save. Finliph hears a voice in his head
      > Ah my friend, you have arived. What can I do for you?
      * Yan See Bin's favored weapon. Seems to have a direct connection
  * Genie:
    * Remembers Nerise, believes her daughter is down below
    * Cannot leave this area, offers a wish for the horn
      * Notes wish could be used to free Ajwa
    * Claims not to know much of Ajwa/Yan's bond/situation
      * Still extremely confident his wish could resolve it
    * Are you Yan See Bin
      * No
      * Shocked and insulted at the question
    * If Yan See Bin ascends, what does it mean for you and other elementals
      * Very little. He was imprisoned becuase he would have caused problems. That is now a solved issue.
    * Was a guardian of the dwarves many years ago. Horn was won and became a symbol of trust between them. Aerisi found it, learned its purpose, used it against him.
    * Says we lack the power to go below and finish Yan See Bin
    * Hole in the floor is a controlled descent, need something extra to ride the air back to this level. Describes wingsuits they use to catch the drafts
  * Wyvern: Still with us as long as it can see Kai
    * Checking its nest: Nothing special. Some daggers/armor
  * Kai says goodbye to Nerise Gladham
  * Fanny loots 10 kilos of opium?! And finds a small wooden box, with some form of herb inside. The scent of which reminds her of her uncle Chad
