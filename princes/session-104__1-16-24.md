## Session 104
* Still exploring the mansion
  * Open the storeroom door, the worst possible smell emanates from it. Even the mold must be rotting! Shadowghast inside
    * Inside the silverware box is eventually found
  * Next room - Workshop
    * Many half finished projects in it. Find skeleton slumped over the desk, sitting in a chair. Two hands out on the table, one on a pictureframe with a small brass plate saying "true love" below it. Under his other hand is a small box, ~8in on largest dimension
      * The box flashes some light when opened, tall creature standing 8-9ft tall, slender, blue/gray skin, gold horns on back of head. A Devil, Tormentor. Collects souls then uses them to do its bidding. Getting captured/killed by it will mean losing your soul
      * It summons shadows, they kill Xano and he begins to become one himself
      * Eventually we kill it, but Xano is still dead and becoming a shadow
      * Nobody can think of any way to revive him before he finishes the transformation
      * Fin speaks to his sword about it. Suggests a ressurection spell at minimum, or a gentle repose to buy time. Or a magic vessel to trap the soul could work.
  * Last room - Ghost of wife calling for husband
* Fannie fashions a proper tombstone for Xanovor
  * A magnificient sculpture of him in a heroic pose, with his cloak seemingly blowing in the wind
  > Here lies Xanovor, the great Lords Alliance... Lackey. Didn't know him long, oh actually what should I say?
* Before leaving Fanny Stoneshape's the teleportation circle, turning it into a hand flipping the bird towards the stable entrance
* Party returns to Bargewright inn to sell, regroup, and resume chasing the boat before moving on to summit hall

## Next time
* Ask around town for info on boat
* Chase boat
* Summit hall?
