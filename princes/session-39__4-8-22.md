## Session 39
* Continuing in the Yan See Bin complex
  * 2 Feathergale priests whipping some people around a tall stone pillar spinning a wheel via some wooden spokes
    * One of the Gladham's among them. The Half-orc father. Says the others are below
  * Feathergale priests are the ones whipping them
  * Gladham tells us the gear somehow relates to water, possibly managing flow. They've only been moving one of the two. We give him food and water, tell them to bar the door behind us. Leave if we aren't back in a day
* Next room: 2 Aaracokra, living quarters
  * 1 priest at the desk - Get him to surrender after Finliph and Kai bloody him
    * Says Windharrow is the personal pet of Aerisi, the head priestess. A powerful Winged Elf, master of air and flight.
    * Hallway behind him has one branch that leads deeper. One branch that leads to another cultist stronghold
    * "Only way down is to fly"
    * Xanavor takes the papers he was working on to give to the alliance later
* Next room: Another Hurricane spell-ey barbarian-ey runed vagabond kind of guy
* Next room: 2 sleeping initiates, killed them.
* See tile change. Well finished, embossed. Hear a low toned humming. We've found the inner sanctum/temple. Sound of scraping rock, straining movement
  * Large person in next room. Vest, puffy pants, not dissimilar from Ajwa
  * Xano's ring shocks him
* Genie tells us Yan See Bin has been found, but not yet freed - Ahtayir
  * His horn is kept by Aerisi, if we can get that, he can help us with Ajwa
  * Points west, her office is that way. Several people there to deal with. She is upstairs. Beware the Wyvern rider who guards the temple
  * Says Aerisi wants Windharrow dead, but he keeps convincing her to keep her around
    * Her ego can be manipulated into keeping us around. She'll despose of us below if not
  * Clearing the compound buys time with Yan See Bin. Massive network of caves beneath, extremely dangerous. Yan See Bin's power there is enormous
  * Stay clear of the northwest ruins. Denizens of the deep who dwell there
  * Wyvern rider - Beats us up a bit, gets shoved into the water, gets eaten. Kai goes for the ride of a lifetime on a Wyvern. Sees that it has a nest up top
* healer's kit after battle
* Debating short rest before proceeding.
