## Session 59
* Sneaking around
  * Middle deck has a bunch of cannons, going all the way around. Lots of barrels filled w/ black powder as well
  * Cargo hold - At least half of them have weapons in them. Cannonballs, crossbows, armor, adventurer/survival gear
    * A few locked chests as well
    * Weapons may have been hurriedly crafted. Look similar to the other market we found, likely going to orcs or other underground factions
      * First chest: Can't open
      * Second chest: 10 white canvas-wrapped bricks. We think healer's kits
        * Takes 1
  * Bugbear and captain are speaking, not sure about what
* Rest
  * Valicea the cat wanders off, and eventually returns with a torn off chunk of a map of the waters around Waterdeep
    * Rosslentar, Nightstone. Clawhole through Nightstone
  * See the bugbear walking the deck while we're below
    * Kai talks to it (of course)
  * Dwarf continues tinkering
  * Near the end hear some yelling topside
* Waterdeep!
  *  Kai buys everyone a souvenir. Xano's is a symbol of Mystra, goddess of magic and of Waterdeep
* To LA headquarters
  * Xano gets told he was reported dead, two weeks ago
    * End of June was when we actually "vanished"
  * 15m later Dricedair herself comes down to greet us
  > Redlarch is _gone_
    * The ground itself seems to have swallowed it up
    * A few survivors, no mention of elementals. They could see a man in monks robes run into the center of town, put down some object (spherical?) in the center, and run away. A few minutes later the ground opened and swallowed the town
    * A second one went off as well
  * Xano informs them about the ship + Yurmdin
  * Dricedair wants us to investigate a mine that has gone silent
    * Chad wants to first check out nightstone, suggests it will take 3 days
    * They need us to get back to the Dessarin valley
  * Firestorm seen in the northern part of the dessarin valley, where the druidic conclave was happening
    * Implied this _could_ be a weapons test
  * The orcs now have all the ranchlands, there is concern they will push in towards the valley
* Kai and Finliph wander off, end up at the temple of Mystra
