## Session 32

  * Extra-planar creatures are generally summoned temporarily. Killing their form here generally kills the avatar, sending them back. If they come through a _gateway_ they are here 100%, at full power and indefinitely. Also subject to true death.
    * Not the same as a god, but for an air elemental aspiring to godhood it might help
  * Gods gain power through worship. To attain godhood, they likely need a sufficient volume of followers

    * Lich had deal with Hellenrae to ignore each other
    * Says we are looking for Yan See Bin, Eldritch power of air. He has watched us since our first arrival
    * At the mention of his name, he winces. Did not expect us to know it? Hurt by hearing it?
