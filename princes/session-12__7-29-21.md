## Session 12
* Checking the room of moving stones for safety - No other doors/entrances/traps
* Loot on bodies:
  * Unique symbol emblazoned on armor (bandits + La'Rock)- See "Symbol - Triangle" - Nobody recognizes it
    * Baragustas from town in the brown robe does not have this symbol
  * Armor is destroyed, swords and crossbows in decent condition
  * La'Rock - Glaive, Splintmail
* Short rest and looking at rocks
  * Grooves in the dirt from rocks moving, but seemingly made by a broom, not the rocks. Not grooves in the ground. Indents where they've been set down
  * Bodies along edge of room seem to have been here a long time, undisturbed, with some reverence. Humanoid, too tall to be dwarven
  * Bodies of the "bandits" do not look familiar from Kai's knowledge of the town
  * Detect magic: low level transmutation covering the entire floor of the room
    * No signs of fading, seems like it's a permanent effect. Different than the rock in the other room though
* Antechamber to statue room: A voice asks what we're doing here, and lets us back out...?
  * Half-orc who sells pickles - Groond
* Going back to rat room - Bodies are somewhat fresh, some in plain clothes, some in brown robes -- Cause of death: Stabbing -- Seemingly by the magical dagger
* South path: Cave-in closed it off partways
* Going up to Groond's room - Kai sneaks around back, Xanavor goes to front to try convincing Groond he's an initiate
  * Xanavor gets smacked with and trapped in a 10 foot cubic cage
  * Rubble in the room, hand sticking out. Whatever's in there is still alive -- Small child, bruised and bloodied, near death
    * Recognize as one of the kids who told us about the haunted tomb - Son of Rothar, asks if his dad is okay
    * Has been under here for almost a day
* Secret door in room of moving stones - Leads out to a quarry near town
* Taking the kid and going to sheriff's. Left Groond under a cage in the cave
* Give sheriff the lowdown
* Go to Rothar's house, no answer. Sheriff shoulders the door open and goes in. Nobody there
* Go to La'Rock's house
  * It's a small shed, has a small book on the table, written in dwarven.
  * Book: Mines of Ironstar
    * There is a section that talks about the room of floating stones. Describes a room that the dwarves weren't sure why but things placed there tended to move
* Sheriff will take care of the boy and put him with someone safe
* Sheriff will hold the money from La'Rock's house for us until investigation is complete
