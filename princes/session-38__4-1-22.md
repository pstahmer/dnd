## Session 38
* Kai is able to track what we think is the right cave. Has been smoothed out.
  * Up until yesterday there were two people stationed here on watch. Aarakocra were here more recently than the guards
  * Cave gets darker faster than makes sense with the lighting conditions outside. Quieter too.
  * Light spells do full distance behind, half distance up ahead
  * Detect magic: Ground and rocks are infused with illusion, a section up ahead on the ground seems effected by conjuration
    * Kai goes up to it. Vanishes. Teleported to cave entrance
    * Field is at least 30ft long
    * Noise seems to be what teleports us. Actually, exhalation.
    * Holding breath we get through. With detect magic see that it was ~50ft. Dark/quiet illusions last another 30ft
* Stairs going down after another 100ft. Echoes of distant voices
  * Large mostly empty cavern. See light and such reflecting off of the ceiling. Hear screams followed by cackling laughter
  * Aarakocra were the source of the noise
* Next hallway. Emaciated figure chained to pillar. Figure is clothed in initiates robes
  * Claims Aerisea did this to them. Learning to survive on air
* Windharrow in the next room. Dimension doors once we kill his 5 subordinates
  * The flutes in the room are made of bone
  * Xanavor reveals parts of his history. Windharrow involved in the deaths of his family, flutes, joining the alliance.
