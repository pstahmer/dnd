## Session 83
* Hear starnge voice speaking in another language as we approach the large creature to the northeast
  * Fanny deciphers it to mean "Who is that in my cave"
  * After fanny replies that it is her and she is searching for her uncle: "Why are you here if he is not dead, this is a place for the dead"
    * You should leave
  * Have the dead been escaping this place? Freed. Home again, not escaping.
  * Mereurr is the creatures name, sounds Nethrise. Meaning "Savage Protector"
    * When asked what freed the dead, replies "I awoke"
    * "The portal has been re-established, we return"
      * "We meaning the ancient, the forgotten, the buried." "The civilization of Nethrill"
  * Approaches almost as a cloud of darkness with a dim light inside it. A Black draconic face appears hovering 15ft above the shadow
    * Looks like some kind of shadow dragon
  * Tells us that we could stop the spirits who leave, the restless. The undead. They were stuck here, buried. Seek an escape. There are magics to ward against them.
    * Need a way to steer or control the undead.
  * The portal to Nethrill is behind him. The restless come from the city around us
  * Is smaller than the emerald dragon we met before. Just his torso is the size of a horse. As dragons go a bit on the young side. But still a dragon
    * Shadow dragon. Neither chromatic nor metallic. Thought to have gone extinct around the time the nethrise empire fell. Their powers are relatively unknown, lost to time. From the shadow essence one assumes undeath and such is in their domain. They breathe death (necrotic breath weapon)
  * Other side of the door contains what was once a beautiful forest. He hasn't yet explored it. The door is new
  * Claims we may be able to help him with his task. One of us has an item (the darkglobe) which infused w/ necromantic energy
* We go back to the surface to long rest. Finliph summons a raven
  *
