## Session 28
* Fought bandits, lost. They knocked us out instead of killing
  * Xano wakes first. Wandering through familiar grasslands. Strung over back of a horse. Can feel that most equipment is gone. Hands/legs are bound, gagged. Can see others on horseback. Fin and Kai are in similar positions
    * Xano -- Kai -- Fin -- Cart
  * one horse in back pulling a cart. Likely with our gear. Appears to be the fancy one that had the coffin before
  * Being taken back to Grimjaw at rivergard -- Why would he send us towards his own men? Might not have known our intent but odd that he didn't mention
    * "We should have never accepted this job"
  * Creep-factor escape like hell, they dump finliph and gallop off, with our gear in their cart
    * They were taking us west, but ran off east when we scared them
    * Finliph summoned the Sword of Nulasemar as his bonded weapon. We have that back at least
* XP Granted - Level 5 achieved

## Goals
* ~~Report to Rivergard keep~~
* Chase down bandits, get back our gear
  * Find out why Grimjaw hired them, if we were specific targets or not. Their chatter left it a tad ambiguous
* Return codebook to Lords Alliance
