## Session 36
* Party buy's Chad a horse, in exchange for the equivalent gold value plus 15% interest after the adventure
* Go to feathergale, sleep before assaulting
* Kai notices more stunted plant/animal growth in the area (quantity this time since he can't find big game)
* We botch ambushing the scouts, a bunch of them are waiting for us when we arrive
  * Giant eagle battering ram!
  * Kill 8 of them despite the ambush with little damage taken thanks to Kai's darkness
  * Raid the armory - 4 longswords, 4 scale mail, 4 shield, 4 helmet, 4 longbow, 4 quivers of 20 arrows each
  * Kill 2 more
  * Chests by bunks. Nothing of value
  * Get to conference room, fight a man named Hurricane. Dirty armor, poorly groomed. Bit barbaric in nature?
    * "looks like somebody you'd find under a bridge" -- No tattoo's or markings, but the air symbol is carved into his skin in scars
    * Also 3 feathergale knights
  * Top level - More generic supplies in the rooms up there. Thurr Murosska seems to not be present
    * Find a letter on his desk
      > Merosska, We are pleased to hear about the outcome of your altercation with the Black Earth cult, and we praise you for the capture of one of their prisoners. This noblewoman from Waterdeep has an interesting tale to tell, and we shall enjoy interrogating her further. Keep a close watch on the Sacred Stone Monastery. I want to know what our enemy is planning next. Your beloved queen, Aerisi Kalinoth

    * 320 gp, potion of heroism, scroll of beastbond, scroll of skywrite
  * Topmost level - Incredible view, and Thurr Murosska with a couple Aaracokra and a couple Griffin riders
