## CABIN SESSIONS
* Resume in the middle of Chad meeting his twin. Rug in center of floor has symbol of cult of fire.  Chad recognizes it as an enemy of Bacob.
  * Chad asks, “What am I doing here?”
  * “The cat didn’t bring you for the ritual?”
* Apparently they’re twin brothers.  Chad doesn’t know anything about it. Cat leaves with twin, upsetting Chad.  His name is Elezar and stayed with mother while Chad went with father.
* Chad dismisses cat to pocket dimension then plays dumb.  Mentions names Vannifer and Imix (name of older elemental god of fire).
* Chad starts smoking the strong opium.
* Find coins and scroll in desk.  Chad tells guards Chad stole the cat and froze them all with magic but failed so combat ensues.  Chad’s spiritual weapon is a rubber chicken that makes the sound of Baccob when it hits. Lots of combat with fire.  Kai gets grabbed by fire elemental in the Burning Man but escapes with misty step.  Engages guard.  Upstairs party kills 2 guards but 1 gets away.  Kai kills 1 guard as Elezar casts Stinking Cloud from the ground.  Kai jumps down and closes the distance with Elezar.
* Xanavor burns Gladiatorial Training. Kai uses 1 card to get Finliph out of range of attacks.

* Chest had 250gp, 2 red fire opals (50gp ea), magic scroll (flame arrows given to Finliph). Chad’s father is named Richard Storm. Raised by high acolyte McHoolehan.
* Guard says boss is Banifer.  Conclave to find out what’s going on in the area but she doesn’t know anything.  Does mention the cult has members in Candlekeep.
* Trapdoor below has a ladder that goes down 40 feet to a tunnel that is similar to the others below other cult places.
* Rest back at our camp with sleepy drugs and level up.
* On Finliph’s watch, cat wanders off and starts drawing circles in the dirt. Finliph meditates and talks to his sword.  It asks if he has chosen a path yet.
* Get 5 doses of sleepy drugs.  Jennie’s sprites are named Afid and Flix.
