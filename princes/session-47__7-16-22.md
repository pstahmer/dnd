## Session 47
* Guard house full of bunks, ~at least 7~ 12 inside
  * Workers, not guards. Working on repairing the castle
  * Some from nearby towns, crop failings. This is a good paying job
  * Xano killed one, Carl from Nightstone
* Go to docks, find the water Genasi boat captain there, asks us what he can do for us tonight
  * During the fight the water Genasi pulled something out of his belt, and it fell into the water when we killed him

  * Finliph follows the last survivor, the rest later run after him
    * Does an entire fight in the last guard tower on his own
