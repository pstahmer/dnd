## Session 15
* Investigating tracks revealed that there were seemingly 4 prisoners with the La'Rock faction
* While investigating we were watched by Bird faction
* Tracked heading north. Pursued after crossing river
* Found fortress, tried to sneak up
* Rider approaches when we're half-mile out, Thaumaturgy "We come in peace, wish to speak. May we approach"
  * Dismounts at 100ft
  * Feathergale Knights
    * Finliph remembers, old stories, from childhood a century ago. Protectors of the realm. Grave symbol not related
  * Woman comes out to speak to us, seemingly leader. Has symbol on armor
    * "Rejoice followers of Yan see bin"
    * Sergeant Savra Belabranta
    * Symbol on armor, but nowhere inside the building
    * Yan See Bin - Detachment, separation from the world. Giving up of personal possessions in favor of nothingness of existence.
      * Two branches:
      * Devout: Focus on nothingness, reality is an illusion. All that you know and understand should be given up
      * Protectors: Those who understand but cannot accept such reasoning. Giving themselves over to protecting those who seek enlightenment
    * Bent truth: The old knights of the spire sought to protect. Did so under similar auspices.
    * Claims to be a protector
  * Knows the other group seeks attachment, rather than detachment. Have been at war for many generations
  * Serving girl may have been beaten
  * Next up: (with the symbol, with minor magic around him) Thur Merosska, protector of the spire
    * "Those of the black earth" referring to the other faction. A cult who see strength in the symbology of this plain
    * They are holed up in the Sacred Stone Monastery
