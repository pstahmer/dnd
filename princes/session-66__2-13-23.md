## Session 66
* Xano collects letter, long-rest, active again near evening

    * Room being ransacked. "What do you know of the two elves who were here"

    * Aethar and Gilear - They're concerned about the blight in the area
    * The other two were in cahoots with the fort

    * This history is part of the tension of our conversation
    * Lord Dreslin Nondar
  * Vannifer came to us a month or two ago with a promise to get rid of the humans. Some were keen to take her up on this offer. The elders decided against it.

* Follow to a haunted tree and see a ghost with massive necromantic effects all around
