## Session 89
* Kai leads us to a hill from his memory, and has us bond as a tribe. Our new tribe name: The Shadowtrackers
  * Clan, not tribe
  * Suddenly as we go through the ritual it turns to night, the firepit lights itself. We see figures appear behind us. Some have leather armor, others bone. Some have weapons, some don't. All have tattoos, each places their hands on our shoulders.
    * They aren't threatening, they aren't off putting.
    * They turn to Kai and the lead woman says
    > Welcome, lost brother. We have heard your calls, we have heard your summons. We have heard that you want a new tribe.
    * Reminds him of his heritage as an Uthgart. Points out that the rest of us know nothing of their ways. Ask what he wishes to put together
  * They declare us a tribe of the Uthgart. Tell us to protect our friends, our family, our home. Our Patron (Kai) has had the dishonor of losing all of those things, multiple times. We shall see if this time he has found a family that wil last.
* Our surroundings return to normal, but it remains night. The fire now starts providing warmth. There is now no tree, but a ring of tents. Seems to be a campsight of the zephyr hawks, we see a small tiefling child run into a tent.
  * Kai remembers this night. For a very _bad_ reason
  * Suddenly we see climbing up the hill on all sides, a horde of barbarians. Well over a dozen. At the top of the hill two more stand. One barking commands, the other casting a spell
  * They cast some kind of terrain effect on us in a 60ft cube. The terrain comes alive and tries to pull us all down
    * We all look like barbarians as well. Recognize each other only by relative position and mannerisms
  * We see kai run out into the night, and it all goes black. We find ourselves back at our own campfire, unharmed, facing each other. Back to our original bodies. Behind each of us a white apparition is once again present. We feel a burning in our forearms, as if a white hot poker has branded us. We see a tattoo on each of our forearms, of mostly light lines, remnants of feathers. A hint at the night of stalking in our arms. We feel connected.
  * Kai pulls a bracelet from his pocket, a reminder of his first hunt. Some claws and fangs on it, belonging to the snow leopard that was his first kill
  > The lead spectre tells us we have experienced some of Kai's formative moments, as well as the ending of his home, family, and all he knew for the second time. The Uthgart was his second home. His first lost to him before memories could even be formed. The third family you now seek in the catacombs below these hills. It is his wish and desire that you be made a new family, tribe, clan. And you have all accepted. And thus with each other, you all have power. And you all are to seek and to protect one another.
* We find ourselves back in the afternoon sun, the scent of lavendar and wildflowers come back to us
  * In front of each of us is a small bowl of yellowish ink. Unbeknownst to us we each had dipped a finger and traced a design into our forearms. It is now burned into place, never again to be removed. We are now a tribe/clan, Kai our leader.
* Gain cool tattoo spells that we can only cast on each other, not ourselves. Kai gains a Talisman marking him as an Uthgart leader

## Next session
