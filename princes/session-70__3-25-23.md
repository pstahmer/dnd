        * Crimson, golden filligree, Coat of arms on the back in alternating red and gold, a crown at the center

        * Historically run by dwarves - Wargok Clan
        * Rumor of avalanche in the mountains
        * Mentions the town may be better off without the mine - Shocking statement. Dwarves see the town as an encroachment on their territory. Part of the resulting treaty is that the town pays essentially a tithe, commerce based.

        * Old fairy tail about the mines being taken from demons, and the dwarves having built protectors

  * Town guard takes us to the main office when he sees Xano is a Warden
    * previous one vanished after maybe 5 days, had been asking about dwarves
    * Bhun was gone a few days later, new guy sitting in his warehouse. Vandrick - Also dwarf but younger one. Bhun was more or less retired and doing this to pass the time
    * Nobody saw Broadswain leave town
      * The lidless - A black market group in town that by and large gets left alone by both town + alliance
    * Asks if LA can send more equipment to the constabulatory
* Warehouse district
  * Most of the equipment shows no sign of recent use
  * 100gp/ton is the usual rate, dwarf asks for an offer on how much per ton to return it to service
  * Dwarf implies they don't need the trade with waterdeep anymore, insists there's no shortage of other supplies
  * Dricedair confirms that there are stipulations in the contract for ending the trade deal, Dwarf agrees to draw up proper paperwork for tomorrow
  * Chad suspects the iron is still being mined, but sold to someone else
  * Stealthing
    * 20m later: Dwarf is gone, lots of documents are burning. Bookshelves and desks are empty. One name survives: Gethmedra
      * Tracks seemingly following the iron rail tracks.
      * Lose his tracks after another 10m or so, but seemed to be going straight. 10m later see lights. Flickering.
        * Laughter, talking, lots of folks here. Sign in common: The Bloody Boar. All races seem represented
        * One guy in long black shimering cloak isn't moving at all. Black reflective match. Golden light behind it. Largely ignored by clientelle
    * Dwarven Tavern:
      * Finliph de-stealths, and starts drinking a _very_ strong drink with them to try befriending for info
      * Rumor is Bhun got kidnapped, someone took over the company. Rumor that he was dealing with Lidless, cops got him. Rumor that he got stabbed, cops killed him. Mining contract referred to as a "cushy gig"
      * Vandrick doesn't give any jobs. No jobs _in_ the mine either
        * Former worker says two jerks in black vests, cloaks, masks took Bhun and vanished. Two days later Vandrick came in and fired everybody
