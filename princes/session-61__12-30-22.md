## Session 61
* Hypnotic pattern, initiative
* She misty steps upstairs, bright orange light ensues
  * Room has broken glass, and some burn marks in the wood. Room looks a little ransacked
  * Teleportation circle - Xano tries to jot down the glyphs as they fade, fails to get them all
    * 1m cast time, she must have had this prepped in advance
* Insight check Chad's cat. It has a connection to another, much the same as its connection to him
  * It looks at the rest of us, and Chad hears: "So the gig is up, huh?"
  * "The gig has always been up."
  * Chad's dad is stuck in the fey wilds and wants Chad to get him out
    * Said he keeps leading us to folks who can help, but Chad keeps messing it up
* Kai finds some paperwork relating to the fort
  * Inventory movements into the fort. Doesn't seem suspicious offhand
  * She grabbed any actually important documents on her way out
* Vannifer was the tiefling's name
  * Chad's brother (Elizar) said that's their mom's name, and that she was the head of the fire cult (Eternal Flame)
* Elves showed up just before we did
* Kai suggests it's odd she wanted the orb. Perhaps it does more than just make lights
* To the fort!
  *  Barkeep mentioned there's been some traffic w/ it recently, but it's not officially in use. Hasn't been since the original lord who built it died
  * Knock on the door, seemingly grumpy fella answers
    * Doesn't recognize the name Elazar when Xano tries to bluff him
    * Does recognize Vannifer's name
