## Session 71
* The Bloody Boar
  * Pub upstairs, bar downstairs. Mostly out of towners. Eccentric crowd, adventurers and such.
    * Bartender (Gabe) note's Kai's interest in the mine
    * Tieflings speaking infernal go silent as he approaches. Cortel and Nithril.
      * Kai asks for work, as much money as fast as possible. They say there are folks looking for strong hands in Dessarin Valley. A few disasters recently
  * Fin and Chad enter and join Kai, Xano goes in 5m later with cloak flashing
  * Swirl of purple light by Xano's table after he makes a scene. Black cloaked/masked man appears at his table, suggesting they need to take their conversation outside.
    * Dimension door, he exits with another casting of it
    * Xano announces he can be found in the AM at the Swinging Banshee by any who have strong arms and a desire for good gold
  * Kai uses a mouse to find the masked figure in a room in the inn. No windows, a few braziers for light.
    * Speaking to a well dressed human woman with a large goblet. Speaking about their departure.
      > Keep an eye out, we don't want lords alliance trouble here
      > Yes mistress
    * Adjacent room appears to be like living quarters. Extremely large room, maybe 40x40, rows of braziers lighting it. Rows of chairs at an angle, with teh floor of the room covered in sand. Possibly an arena.
    * Woman kills mouse with a throwing dagger
    * We figure it must be a basement
  * Chad hears
    > Do you think the stone's gonna fight in the arena tonight? No I think tomorrow, against the chimera crew
  * Finliph starts a bar fight
  * Chad finds out that there's a fight tomorrow night
* Try to sneak into the basement. Hidden door in the stone
  * 40ft down the stairs, hallway and more stairs
  * down the additional stairs is some light.
  * Room: Small fountain, hall to the right, straight ahead is a wide hallway with double doors on the end
  * Guard stops us, back upstairs and left to their boss
* Woman comes out when we ask to speak to Gethmedra
  * When pressed, she never gives a hint of anything, and denies everything. When Bhun is mentioned the teleporting guard does however twitch
  * They also threatened that the same would happen to Xano as did his predecessor
* Dricedair report
  * They wouldn't normally do this unprovoked
  * Interesting, see if you can find out why they'd risk it with the lord's alliance
  * No explicit reprisal for Broadswain, find out more first

  ## Todo
  * Create rumor that Gethmedra is cooperating with the lords alliance
    * Gethmedra only _threatened_ to start a Xanovor rumor, is not doing so yet
