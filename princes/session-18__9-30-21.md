## Session 18
* Going back to camp for a day or so after the duergar killing. Rest for the day, level up. Best day ever.
* 1h invisibility for Kai to scout out. 15m to get there, after 10m of waiting sees 2 monks walk out
  * They seem to be searching for our camp, though not certainly so
  * Seemed to have snuck out of the monastery
  * Retrieve them, bring back to camp with campfire lit
  * "not the will of our masters" to take revenge for their dead
  * Same leaders for as long as these two have been members
    * Qarbo is newer though
    * Main leader is a woman named Hellenrae
      * Has a handful of "trusted" monks close to her who do her bidding
  * La'Rock may have been a missionary
  * Can literally ask for her by name and get to see her
  * Sebastion and Brock were the two who came to us

* Kai sneaking in while we discuss plans with Hellenrae
  * Finds some kind of scythe monster person thing. Imprisoned and attempting to get out
    * UMBER HULK
  * Red dirt/sand with a big stone in the middle. Very unique stone. 10/10 would purchase again
  * Helenrae takes us apart, asks what our plan vs the feathergale would be
  * She is master of this monastery, not of this order. Mirage Vison is the leader.
  * Ask about emissaries, imply that we worry the other faction attacked them

* End back at camp
