## Session 102
* Reunion! Fanny and Finliph got into Bargewright in earlier than Kai and Xano
  * Finliph gets lucky and finds a blue tile! It's large, 1.5ft/1.5ft,
    * Woman selling it has a white grub with a human face -- Grey wastes currency?
    * She shares that it is part of a glyph of protection, one large enough to protect an entire city if all the pieces were found
    * She suspects she knows who he is gathering them for when he offers to buy any future tiles she has, but says she has reservations about selling to him given who will receive the tiles in the end
    * She sells the tile, and says to tell Kathir the rest will cost him much more
  * Fanny sells the nethrise lights, merchant says something about artifacts "already coming out of that" and how the price will soon go up.
    * A reference to the lords alliance heading for red larch after Xano informed them?
* Team tries to plan, thinking either rivergard keep or high forest for a Monastary Finliph wants to check in on and thinks may have info about the rituals
  * Summit hall seems a good next step as a middle ground between them as well as a place with potentially some info
* Xano visits Ajwa, bringing Fin and Fanny with him
  * Thunder spear is part of Yan See Bin. No way to have it maintain power without also maintaining the connection to him
    * Destroying it near his portal may be sufficient to close said portal
  * How to destroy portals
    * Each is powered by different magic. The draogn in the Nethrise temple was similar
      * Each can be closed in a bit of reaction to its nature. The orbs have effect, opposite magics for obvious reasons
        * Orb of air might not be strong enough to close its opposite, but absolutely would disrupt it so something else may close it
        * Similar to how we had to dispel the protections around the shadow dragon's portal
      * Imix (fire) probably has something with light and dark orbs, or magical items in general. Light/Dark Orbs are more life/death than straight elements. Not directly fire, but possibly a shortcut that cult came up with
      * Olhydra - Fey have inherent power, though nymphs don't have much. Eladrin would be far more valuable to powering a portal
        * A trap for the eladrin? Or maybe an orcish plot rather than an elemental one
        * Old stories of an ancient ocean monster whos favorite food was Fey. Maybe they were taken to be used as bait for a creature that could power the portal
        * Powering that portal: Greed can't, but maybe if thousands wanted their money, or if a creature is feeding off the greed the portal may in turn feed off of them
  * Crafting
    * Xano asks if Ajwa can use some of these items he's collected to craft an item with connection to him
    * Requests Xano bring him some high quality inks and such, asks him to make the ring warm whenever he passes his hand over a material that will work
    * Xano wants to also get him a couple other scented pouches in general after his reaction to the lavendar
  * Finliph asks about the genie he has a contract with
  * 1:1 - Warns Xano that someone with as many secrets as Fanny has, the secrets come back
    * Xano's ancestors did a great favor, in return he must provide service to the family
    * Grandfather got in similar amounts to trouble as Xano is in now. Father wished to avoid that fate for himself and have a normal life. Secrets however did eventually come for him
* Some additional shopping in the AM, refresh the party fund via selling
* Finliph sees a familiar ship captained by a blue-skinned woman heading south down the river

## Next time
* Follow the ship?
* Summit hall to check on rancher survival, possibly more local/portal info
* Star mount
  * Check on elves
  * Try to get in touch with Eladrin to follow up on Nixies
    * Possible Olhydra lead?
