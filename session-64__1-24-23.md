## Session 64
* Finliph looks for wood elves, who have left already. Gets us banned from Dwarf's inn
* Xano leaves letter behind for Peryoel about their intentions to investigate under the fort, needs to retrieve it when we're done
* In the basement
  * half-destroyed seal that looks in the shape of a dragon. Seemingly recently destroyed
    * Seal of Bahamut
    * Not magical
  * Mounted dinosaur head on the wall
  * Finliph engulfed in a green light from the south, streaking across and just missing him. Where it hits the wall, the wall is just gone
    * BEHOLDER!
      * Skin sloughing off, doesn't seem to be right
  * Old temple room. Stone benches, alter, etc. Stones and figures seem to have been destroyed. Crude Eternal Flame symbol carved into the walltt
    * Floating ball of light inside that tries to zap Kai
      * Will o wisps and zombies pull themselves up out of the ground (fresh, shallow graves) and attack us
  * Another room: Large cage w/ pieces missing, probably where the Beholder came out of?
  * Empty room
  * Nothing suspicious about the dinosaur head
  * Well - Water seems suprisingly good, nonmagical. Minerally, but tastes fine
* Prisoners told us Vanifer spent a lot of time down here, was she zombifying her hirelings? And a beholder somehow?!
