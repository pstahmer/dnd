## Session 72
* Vandrick was not a stone dwarf, non-native.
* Dwarven contracts:
  * Mining contract: Ludwuzack clan to mine, hitting certain quotas with certain pricing ranges. Clan to decide who their representative. Unclear if Vandrick was such, he burned much of the paperwork
  * Waterdeep leases the land for Rosslintar, paying essentially via a sales tax within the town as a tithe to the clan
* Note in the night:
  > The stone dwarf fights tomorrow at the bloody boar
  * Implying Bhun Ludwazack? Was dropped off by another dwarf
* During his watch Xanovor gets hit by something warm and wet on the lips. Dark green when he wipes it away. Someone snuck in and poisoned all of us, only Kai fails the throw
  * Fly out the window, see them hiding on a roof in a pocket of shadow
  * Outfit matches the guards from the fighting pit. Cloth-wrapped ninja-esque
    * Half-elf seems to be the culprit, drops the ninja gear and tries to sneak away
  * Catch him in a hold person, make pronouncement to town, take him back to the room.
    * Kai proceeds to torture him by repeatedly burning his body with a torch
      > Lords alliance needs to back off
      * I was a hired hit, the lords alliance is not meant to be here.
      * We let Broadswain through, he went to the mine. Bhun was ours
      * Offers to tell us where Bhun is -- At the fighting pit. A special place for "special" fighters where he's become a favorite in the last month
        * Down the stairs, to the bottom. Before the pit is a side-hall. Fighters of renown are kept there under watch and key. He brings in a lot of money but his days are numbered.
      * Reports to Devamari (the one with the mask)
* Xano talks to warden sets up plan to hide the assassin as a drunk guy who took a swipe at the warden. They'll hold him for a day and send him south with a caravan gaurd for 8gp
  * While discussing the plan Dricedair notes that the priorities are:
    1. Iron contract
    2. Bhun
    3. Broadswain
* Finliph gets his bunghole fingered by Chad, storms off

## Next time
* Reconcile w/ Finliph on all the magic usages to prank him
* Follow up on iron contract
