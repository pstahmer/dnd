## Session 75
* Seem to have an automated track line with hanging baskets moving rocks around. They seem to be moving ore into the smelter
* Take out all the gargoyles
* Door to office is unlocked, apparently the medusa uses it but isn't there now. She wanders the mines
  * Several parchments on desk, including one with a LA seal. Iron chest under the desk
    * LA scroll: Inventory + receipts for iron purchases. Financial transactions. Several months old
    * Iron chest: Treasure! Canvas, silver hairpiece, copper chalice (engraved), 50gp
      * Beautiful regal woman on the painting. Very fine. Seemingly cut from its frame. Est: 250gp
      * Haircomb is beautiful, ornate, etc. 50gp
      * Chalice is engraved with a face matching the painting. And a crowd of others. Other side has the symbols from the comb
      * Symbols don't match any language we know
      * Part of a set?
* Xano sends the surviving dwarves back to the surface
