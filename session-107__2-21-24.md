## Session 107
* Talk to mayor again, Firatril offers reward for fixing weather:
  * Necklace of fireballs - 9 beads - 7k value?
* Plan for the trip
  * Kai hunts up a massive amount of furs and meats, enough to create clothes for all of us honestly.
  * Gets a rush job on garments from it all
* Yoreel plays at a bar, sets down a *beret* for coin collection, then starts a dice game in the corner with the proceeds
  * Gets a cloak (spotted leopard, fur-lined), but notices people get fearful when talk turns to the winter
* Finliph meditates with his sword
  * The sword asks if he'll continue east to the site of one of his biggest losses
    * Also mentions that most worthy of the sword have become great leaders, and that Finliph himself has started taking his own steps
  * Something east that not even Nulasemar found. Sword was forged in this forest thousands of years ago. Bathed in a spring on the easter side. Hellgate.
    * Many previous wielders mediated upon the sword in that spring, seen as a trial to unlock its potential.
  * Notes that while Finliph claims to seek help, he again finds himself offering it. Also says that true leaders find that they offer help more often than they ask for it
  * The disruption at the monastery is one that feels familiar
