## Session 85
* Fanny approaches the dragon on her own, we try to keep some monitoring on her w/ Finliph/Midnight
  * Dragon wants the item that smelled of necromancy as payment for helping Fanny cast a spell
  * Alternatively, would accept a human life
    * A cow will not work, must be a sentient life. The death of a sentient has meaning
* Attempt to negotiate with dragon long enough for Fanny to cast Geas on it
  * It's purpose is protection of this portal. To bring its people home. The item would make the portal permanent, meaning it doesn't need to stay and its people can return as they see fit.
* We fight dragon, we kill dragon
  * Kai harvests a couple teeth, and a couple decent-sized scales. Maybe enough to make a small set of armor
  * 1oz vial of shadow dragon blood - Xano dumped out his ink for this
* Speak with dead on dragon:
  1. Will the portal close on its own?
    * It will remain open, for a while?
  2. How old are you
    * Thousands of years?
  3. Don't you wish you took me up on my offer to be BFF's
    * Simply give me the elf's orb and I would have helped you
  4. Where's your treasure?
    * I have none, but there is some beyond the door
  5. Will we die if we go through the portal?
    * Only if the keepers distrust you
  * Reminder: Not obligated to be truthful

## Next time:
1. Get through the stone door
2. Avoid the portal...?
  1. Close the portal?
