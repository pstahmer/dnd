## Session 30
* Cart with Nulasemar's body is missing. An apparition tells us they took it, and that we need to bring it the body of Samular Caradoon. To be delivered to Sacred Stone Monastery
  * founder -- that'll be hard to get
  * Brother disappeared - lich, phylactery in Summit Hall
  * We remember a similar robed figure at Sacred Stone. Pale, drawn out face, possibly a lich? Possibly the brother of the founder?
* Summit hall - Explain slightly to guards, heavily armored man comes out to meet us in the courtyard
  * After explanation he is able to slightly illuminate the wagon, has a guard fetch someone else
  * Woman in very fine dress comes out. Seems important. White + blue dress, mostly white. "The lady of Summit Hall" Ushien Stormbanner
    * Swedish Bikini model
  * Confirms it was the brother. Has been trying to enter for many years, thus far unsuccessfully
    * Renwig - Anathema, but not openly harmful. No desire to end him
  * We help intern the body
    * Finliph has a moment with the body and sword, realizes Nulasemar's vow was not only to protect others (+elves), but to work _with_ others to do so.
      * This motivated him to join other nations and act in concert with them
      * As he says a similar vow and touches the sword, he hears "I can work with this."
        * Expects him to pick up where Nulasemar left off
  * Suggest that if they dig up any info on Rivergard, they will share
* Split party - Kai to ranch, Fin/Xan to weapons, 3 lvl 3 companions
  * 1 cleric, 2 paladin
* Selwyn - Smoking rubble, find Mr. Selwyn's unconscious form on the ground
  * Was potentially tortured
  * Orcs! They took his family, out of the high forest
  * Brings him and the horses back to Summit Hall
* Weapons shipment
  * Don't find 'em. Womp womp.
* Kai whispers?
  * Enchantment aura?
  * Claims Ajwa told him that the feathergale were digging for an ancient temple to Yan See Bin
    * Xanavor's ring glows warmly
* Kai appears to be trying to have a conversation with Finliph, without Xanavor
* Whispers galore
