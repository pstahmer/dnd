## Session 52
* We take our seats at the table, Olhydra does as well
  * Apologizes for the stronghanded tactics in getting us here, refers to us as a thorn in his side. Have caused chaos, have cased confusion, have ruined rituals.
  * Refers to arming the orcs as "just for fun" -- As is arming the humans
    * Get the vibe the profits are why he likes it. Chaotic in nature?
  * Respects our strengths
  * Asks about each of our parents, asks where our gods were when things happen to them
  * If his stronger followers are killed he will be agrieved, and have to find another way
  * Makes us offers
    * Join him. In exchange for power
    * Get out of his way. He sets us up somewhere with a ship and some crew
    * Die
  * Kai rejects it all outright, proclaiming his fondness of the party and town and how even if they aren't the strongest, nothing will happen to them unless it's over his dead body
    * The response is essentially rage and teh collapse of the safe space within the plane. As we jump through the portal Xanavor uses a thunderstep to try taking the portal down.
    * Olhydra laughs the whole time as they leave, including as the thunderstep went off
  * As we come out we do so underwater. Above us we see a faint blue circle seemingly swirling in the water. In the opposite direction we see a grey light. The water started out salty and cold, but after a moment it turns oily and almost brackish. Almost as though it's being ruined as we go through it. The circle behind us shrinks and shrinks until only the grey light remains
    * Xanavor loses his cloak
    * We all make it to the surface eventually
* We are in the middle of a large lake, the sky grey. We can neither see the sun nor discern the direction. Tall grass along the shore. 4 things stick out to us, almost as though as cardinal directions
  * Large tree covered in fog, large green leaves peeking out
  * Small run down cabin, a few leafless trees around it
  * Opposite the tree, the grasslands beyond are overshadowed by clouds that get progressively darker, almost to black. Faint white lightning in the distance
  * Grand series of Mountains, grey lights dancing around like fireflies.
* Everything is shades of grey. There isn't a shred of color anywhere in sight. No sign of wildlife
* As we get to the cabin Xanavor has a level of exhaustion from the swim. The sand is white as fresh snow. Seems to be sand, but there are no shells, no rocks. Instead we occasionally see bones sticking out of it.
  * The trees aren't made of wood. They are made out of skeletons fused into structures designed to resemble trees.
  * Wood of the cabin is made of the wood of these trees - Gleam of white bone shows through in parts of the cabin. A whisp of smoke comes from the chimney. The windows are opaque, caked in grime. Every so often we catch a small glimmer of light shining through
  * As we light torches, the shimmers of light inside the cabin go out
* Finliph meditates upon his sword. Is greeted by a spirit, but a different one than before. A beautiful elf in tight black leather armor
  * The same spirit, just a part of the whole
  * The grey waste, a lower plane of the afterlife. We aren't dead, but we have been sent here.
    * A place where tormented souls go. Those who have lost too much or left the world by their own hand
    * All plains connect to another at some point. Denizens of them do tend to be powerful and sometimes cross plains themselves
    * Mostly Fey and Fiend. Some lesser beings as well. And of course the souls of the damned.
      * Fiends - Loths are neutral evil, devil are lawful, demon are chaotic
* Kai's primeval awareness reveals that nearby are fey, fiends, undead. Lake is over a mile in diameter
* Kanine footprints going to and from the cabin
  * Next to the door is what looks like a dog. As it turns its head to us we are startled to see a human-ish face on it. Some kind of mask. Howls as we approach then puts its head back down. Kai feeds it a little.
    * Yeth Hound - Fey, semi-intelligent (child-like). Usually lean evil. Can stun with their howls
* Door bursts open as we approach. Beautiful elven woman w/ long grey-white hair and slinky robe steps out. No color on her. Doesn't speak elvish
  * Polymorph spell on her -- Likely not an elf
    * Claims its because she's not the most attractive in her normal form
    * Drops it, we see a crooked bent over ooooold woman with dark skin, smeagol-like hair and tattered rags of clothing. Warts too.
    * Religion check: Two recognize her as a Night Hag. Almost Fiend/Fey hybrid. Similar to the one we saw in the water dungeon who made SeaLiph
      * Evil vile creatures, but willing to make deals. Unusual to come across two, especially alone. Usually they are parts of Covens to pool their power
  * Asks where we are from -- Material Plane
    * Says she can get us back there, but we'll have to do something for her
      * Wants her sister back. She is like her, is being held *points to the mountains* in a keep over there. Bring her to me and I can send you home. The leader of the keep is holding her. Nakrim. He is a powerful Fiend. We would not be able to defeat him conventionally. Takes powerful magics or powerful weapons.
        * Sister captured by "A deal gone bad" with Nakrim, a Loth
    * Chad asks for something we could say to let her know we're allies. She instead rips out her eyeball and gives it to us
  * To trade for knowledge of our surroundings she brings out a black jar of maggots. One stares at us with a human face, a look of utter despair on it. "Bring me another one of these"
    * Three larva per question - "This is our currency" - Slow to harvest, but possible
    * Xano offers the Nethrise tomb water, her eyes glow gold for a moment while she inspects it.
      * 3 questions for this. Xano negotiates up to 4 with the stipulation that no questions are about her. And that we can get 3 larva per question we don't ask.
      1. If we spent a day by the foggy tree, what would we find? Everything. Literally everything is connected to that tree. It is called Yggdrasil. The tree that connects planes to all others
      2. What are the denizens of the plains? That area is no different than this one.
      3. Cycle of Apocalypses - The cycles are actually every 100 years. They just don't always show up on the same plane. The beings that we speak of aren't always the same. This time it's elementals, this is not always the case. The being that starts the cycle is always the same. It is in fact a source that she herself draws her powers from. We may have heard of the Evil Eye. Whenever it makes an attempt to break free of its prison it finds four champions to break it out. If those four champions are stopped then he has to find four new ones. If you want to stop him you'll either need to stop all 4, or meet and stop him. Then he'll be back 100 years later, he always is.
        * Later: "Oh that? That has nothing to do with me"
      4. How can Xanovor purify his pact with Ajwa - However you have your pact he's not in the ring, he never was. Whatever happend to your patron is hard to tell. I can tell you that the ring has been split. It goes to two places now. If you can sever the connection you don't want you may be able to help your master.
* The grass isn't grass. Is fabric, leather, even shards of metal. All sticking straight up in the air. Every once in a while they move almost like grass in the wind, but without any wind actually blowing.
  * Kai finds an old piece of armor in it, a white dust in it. It starts to decay in his hands, then a strip of it peels itself off the armor and stands straight up. Then another, and another. The armor unwinds into long strips of "grass"
  * Eventually finds a grub on one of the strips of grass. Again with a human face, tears running down it as a look of utter depression takes the face.
* Second favor for the hag: In town is a bartender, shitty old codger. One of the most prized posessions in the fort. A painting that still has its color. She wants it.
* Trying the glowglobe can see some color in a 6 inch range
* Long rest - Ajwa ring
  * As they do so, Xanavor tries to detect magic and enter the ring. Can't detect any "fork" in the road on his way into the ring. He can detect some of the magics involved with transporting and detects a conjuration effect. He thinks he did see a second conjuration layered on top of the first.
    * As he pokes around he inspects the cloth, pulls it back. There's a second identical cloth immediately behind it. When he pulls back that one there's nothing behind it. Looking elsewhere he finds more evidence of things "doubling up"
    * Hookah, puff of smoke. It's subtle but it almost seems like there are two rings of smoke, one overlayed on the other as he blows out.
    * "Ah my friend, it has been a long time, how have you been?"
    * Elements in all things, thus their connection is to many planes.
    * Describes boredom, then overstimulation, the need for breaks.
    * Pocket dimensions help filter out the noise
    * "Don't trust a night hag", quick way out but the tree is safer.
    * He has been to all the planes the tree can reach, flown through it's leaves, conversed with its spirits.
    * The tree connects planes, you can simply walk across a branch and find yourself on another plane
    * Hard to find the right branch, need someone to help you navigate
    * Ancient beings bet with each other more than strike deals, implied to often be about mortals
    * Xano's father: Chatted briefly, wasn't interested. Love took him in a different direction.
