## Session 99
* See a triton (kirin) offloading a ship that looks familiar, start bartering with them. Claim we need some cargo transported without many questions asked.
  * See a lady with tentacle hair on the ship as well as they are finishing unloading.
    * Triton race, Skald thinks she has a hefty bounty
  * Believe the woman is the captain, the guy we were talking to was probably just managing the inventory/unloading
  * Ship has a more ornate version of the Crushing Wave symbol
* After we trigger her, she makes a tidal wave come over the pier. 4 figures remain standing after it washes away

MEANWHILE...
* Fannie wakes up underground, but unable to make out many details beyond the stone walls
  * Disguises herself as a drow, teleports out, and starts exploring her surroundings
  * Gets stopped by a couple Drow, can't understand what they say to her. Just plays it off confidently somewhat ignoring them and they seem confused.
  * She even manages to bluff her way through a guarded door, terrifying the one guarding it on the other side
  * Finds three teleportation circles
  * Moves on, picking up a couple escorts as she goes across a bridge. On the other side she sees some mining carts and a track that goes off beyond her darkvision
    * Escorts start trying to ask her questions, seem confused by her actions
  * Finds some clay and eventually casts Tongues so she can understand them
  > My lady, what happened to your own escort back to the underdark
  * Communicates that she wants to go upwards instead
